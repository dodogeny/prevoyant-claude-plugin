# Prevoyant - Claude Code Plugin `v1.3.6`

**Prevoyant** is a [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) plugin — an AI agent team that runs a structured, end-to-end developer workflow for Jira tickets. Four modes:

- **Dev Mode** — hand Claude a ticket key and it walks through the full cycle: ticket ingestion → root cause analysis → proposed fix → PDF report → KB update → Bryan's retrospective.
- **PR Review Mode** — hand Claude a ticket key with the word `review` and Prevoyant's Engineering Panel reviews the code changes on the associated feature branch, producing a structured PDF findings report.
- **Estimate Mode** — hand Claude a ticket key with the word `estimate` and Prevoyant's Engineering Panel runs Planning Poker. Each engineer scores the ticket across three dimensions (complexity, risk, repetition) drawing on their acquired system knowledge and the shared KB, then votes simultaneously. Structured debate continues until the team reaches unanimous consensus.
- **KB Review Mode** — run `/prevoyant:dev kb review` (no ticket needed) to process the KB Flow Analyst queue in one pass: Step 13j (KB Flow Analyst proposals → `core-mental-map/`). Closes the intelligence loop without consuming a Jira ticket.

---

## Overview

Invoke the skill with a Jira ticket key and Claude runs a structured multi-step workflow — no manual searching, no copy-pasting ticket details, no guessing where to start.

### Dev Mode — `/prevoyant:dev PROJ-1234`

1. **KB query** — pull the team's knowledge base; surface prior knowledge on the ticket's components
2. **Ingest ticket** — fetch Jira fields, description, attachments, and all linked tickets
3. **Analyse & contextualise** — produce a problem statement, acceptance criteria, and an optional draw.io flow diagram
4. **Read comments** — extract prior investigation findings, decisions, and constraints
5. **Create branch** — determine the correct base branch (fix version → affected version → development) and check out `Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_{Title}`
6. **Locate affected code** — grep-first/read-second approach; build a file map with confidence gate
7. **Replicate the issue** — numbered reproduction steps with prerequisites, expected vs actual, service restart guidance
8. **Root cause analysis** — Engineering Panel (Morgan chairs; Alex, Sam, Jordan investigate; Henk provides domain authority and client-value assessment; Riley assesses test coverage) for bugs; Direct Analysis for enhancements; scored verdict + Root Cause Statement + Henk's business-necessity check-in
9. **Propose the fix** — code changes anchored to the Root Cause Statement; Morgan fix review; optional apply to branch
10. **Impact analysis** — usage reference search, layer-by-layer impact table, regression risks, retest checklist
11. **Change summary** — files touched, commit message, PR description template ready to paste
12. **Session stats** — elapsed time, actual token usage and cost via codeburn (falls back to estimation if Node.js unavailable)
13. **PDF report** — full-detail report saved to `CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR`; emailed if `PRX_EMAIL_TO` is set
14. **Update KB** — write session record; push to shared repo if distributed
15. **KB buildup steps** — 13j: Sam reviews KB Flow Analyst proposals in `kbflow-pending.md`; unanimous panel vote; approved entries written to `core-mental-map/`
16. **Bryan's retrospective** — Scrum Master audits token spend, flags process friction, proposes one SKILL.md improvement; unanimous team vote; pushes to main after `PRX_SKILL_UPGRADE_MIN_SESSIONS` sessions

### PR Review Mode — `/prevoyant:dev review PROJ-1234`

1. **KB query** — pull the team's knowledge base; surface prior knowledge on the ticket's components
2. **Read ticket** — fetch Jira fields and description
3. **Understand problem** — full analysis including all linked tickets and attachments
4. **Read comments** — extract prior investigation and decisions
5. **Fetch code changes** — locate the feature branch; run `git diff` to retrieve the full changeset
6. **Engineering Panel review** — same team as Dev Mode, now operating as reviewers: Alex (code quality), Sam (logic + acceptance criteria), Jordan (20-pattern defensive checklist), Henk (business rule alignment and client-value impact), Riley (test coverage); Morgan scores and delivers a binding verdict
7. **Consolidated findings** — Critical/Major/Minor issues with `file:line` and fix recommendations; Positives; Conditions for Approval
8. **Session stats** — elapsed time, actual token usage and cost via codeburn (falls back to estimation if Node.js unavailable)
9. **PDF review report** — saved as `{TICKET_KEY}-review.pdf` in `CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR`
10. **Update KB** — record review verdict, confirmed rules, pattern bumps; push if distributed
11. **Bryan's retrospective** — same as Dev Mode; token audit uses review session stats

**Review verdict:** ✅ APPROVED / ⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / 🔄 REQUEST CHANGES / ❌ REJECT

### Estimate Mode — `/prevoyant:dev estimate PROJ-1234`

Story points measure **effort** — not hours. Each vote scores three dimensions: **Complexity** (how hard), **Risk** (how uncertain), **Repetition** (how familiar). Scale: 1 · 2 · 3 · 5 · 8 · 13 · 20 · ? (spike needed).

Each engineer draws on their **acquired system knowledge** and the shared KB (`core-mental-map/`, `patterns.md`, `gotchas.md`, past ticket estimates, lessons learned) before committing to a vote — ensuring estimates are grounded in what the team actually knows about the codebase, not gut feel.

1. **KB & system knowledge load** — pull KB; each engineer reads architecture, gotchas, data-flows, past estimates on similar components, and lessons learned before voting
2. **Ingest ticket** — fetch Jira fields, acceptance criteria, linked sub-tasks; surface existing story points as reference only (team does not anchor on it)
3. **Scope & dimension analysis** — Engineering Panel jointly maps work areas and rates Complexity / Risk / Repetition with KB evidence before any individual votes are cast
4. **Planning Poker Round 1** — all panel members vote simultaneously; each scores all three dimensions through their domain lens (Morgan: architecture; Alex: backend; Sam: business logic; Jordan: infrastructure; Henk: business rules and client workflows; Riley: testing) citing specific KB entries
5. **Debate & consensus** — if votes differ, structured rounds anchored to specific dimensions: highest voter explains which dimension is underweighted and why (citing system knowledge); lowest responds with counter-evidence; others react; re-vote
6. **Morgan's final call** — if no consensus after 3 rounds, Morgan makes a binding decision citing the deciding KB evidence; dissenting view recorded
7. **Final estimate** — agreed story points, dimension summary, confidence level (High/Medium/Low), key assumptions, what would change the estimate
8. **KB update** — records estimate with dimension breakdown and any `[ESTIMATE-PATTERN]` complexity insights for future sessions
9. **Bryan's retrospective** — audits whether estimates were grounded in KB evidence; proposes SKILL.md improvements (opt-in)

**Confidence levels:** High = unanimous Round 1 · Medium = Round 2 · Low = Round 3+ or Morgan call

## ⚠️ Human Oversight Required

Prevoyant is an AI-assisted development tool. Like all AI systems, it **can and does make mistakes** — misread intent, propose incorrect fixes, draw wrong conclusions from incomplete evidence, or promote an observation that later proves wrong.

**Every output requires human review before it is acted on:**

| What the AI produces | What you must do |
|---|---|
| Root cause statement and fix proposal | Read and validate before applying to the branch |
| PR review findings | Treat as a second opinion — not a final verdict |
| Estimates | Use as a starting point; team context overrides |
| KB entries and `[KB+]` markers written at session end | Review the commit diff before pushing |
| Cortex observations queued for auto-promotion | Check `/dashboard/cortex` regularly; reject anything that looks wrong |
| Field intel entries promoted via P2P mesh consensus | Verify the finding is factually correct before it becomes KB truth |
| KB Flow Analyst proposals in `kbflow-pending.md` | Panel vote (Step 13j) exists precisely because the AI can misidentify flows |

**Autonomous features reduce friction, not accountability.** `AUTO_MODE=Y`, Cortex autonomy level 2+, and P2P mesh consensus promotion all reduce the number of manual steps — but they do not remove your responsibility to monitor what enters the shared KB. Set `PRX_CORTEX_AUTONOMY_LEVEL=0` or `1` on a new team while you build confidence in the system's output quality.

> Prevoyant is a force-multiplier for skilled developers, not a replacement for professional engineering judgment. The AI panel debates, proposes, and records — **you decide what ships.**

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1 — Clone and run setup (one command)

**macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dodogeny/prevoyant-claude-plugin.git \
  ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/dodogeny && \
  bash ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/dodogeny/scripts/setup.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/dodogeny/prevoyant-claude-plugin.git `
  "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\dodogeny"
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\dodogeny\scripts\setup.ps1"
```

The setup script:
- Installs prerequisites: `uvx` (Jira MCP), Node.js (budget tracking), pandoc (PDF reports)
- Runs `npm install` in `server/` (libp2p, lmdb, express, …) and warns if native build tools are missing
- **Prompts for your Jira URL, email, API token, and repo path** — writes them to `.env` directly
- Registers the plugin marketplace in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Installs and enables the `prevoyant@dodogeny` plugin

> **Get your Jira API token:** https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens

### Step 2 — Run it

```
/prevoyant:dev PROJ-1234
```

That's it. The plugin is ready.

> **Reminder:** Review every proposed fix, KB entry, and Cortex promotion before accepting it. AI output always requires human judgment. See [Human Oversight Required](#️-human-oversight-required).

---

**Other modes:**
```
/prevoyant:dev review PROJ-1234     ← PR code review
/prevoyant:dev estimate PROJ-1234   ← Planning Poker estimation
/prevoyant:dev kb review            ← KB Review Mode (no ticket needed)
```

> **Verify Jira is connected** — open a Claude Code session in the project directory and ask `search for Jira issue PROJ-1`. If the MCP is configured correctly, Claude returns the issue details.

> **How credentials work:** `.mcp.json` (committed, no secrets) tells Claude Code to run `uvx mcp-atlassian`. `mcp-atlassian` reads `JIRA_URL`, `JIRA_USERNAME`, and `JIRA_API_TOKEN` directly from `.env` — no editing of any config file needed.

---

### Already cloned? Run setup from inside the directory

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh        # macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash
.\scripts\setup.ps1          # Windows PowerShell
scripts\setup.cmd            # Windows CMD / double-click
```

Safe to re-run at any time — skips steps that are already complete and backs up your `.env` before touching it.

---

### Manual credential setup (if you skipped the prompts)

Open `.env` and set:

```bash
PRX_REPO_DIR=/absolute/path/to/your/repo
JIRA_URL=https://yourcompany.atlassian.net
JIRA_USERNAME=your.name@yourcompany.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
```

---

## Configuration Reference

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` — Claude Code loads it automatically from the project root. All variables are optional unless marked required.

### Required

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PRX_REPO_DIR` | Absolute path to your local repository clone, e.g. `/home/alice/projects/myrepo`. The skill creates branches here and searches this directory for code. |
| `JIRA_URL` | Your Atlassian base URL, e.g. `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net` |
| `JIRA_USERNAME` | Your Atlassian account email |
| `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | Jira API token — generate at [id.atlassian.com](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) |

> `JIRA_URL`, `JIRA_USERNAME`, and `JIRA_API_TOKEN` are read by the Atlassian MCP server directly from the environment. `.mcp.json` (already committed, no credentials) just specifies the command — no editing needed.

### Knowledge Base

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_KB_MODE` | `local` | `local` — KB on this machine only. `distributed` — KB in a shared private git repo. |
| `PRX_KNOWLEDGE_DIR` | `$HOME/.prevoyant/knowledge-base` | Override the local KB path (local mode only). |
| `PRX_KB_REPO` | — | URL of your team's private KB git repository (distributed mode — required). |
| `PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE` | `$HOME/.prevoyant/kb` | Local clone path for the KB repo (distributed mode). |
| `PRX_KB_KEY` | — | AES-256-CBC passphrase for encrypting KB files at rest (distributed mode, optional). |

### Source Repository Cross-Check (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_SOURCE_REPO_URL` | — | Hosted URL of your codebase (e.g. `https://github.com/myorg/myrepo`). When set, the skill cross-checks KB `file:line` references against the live main branch. Omit to skip. |

### Report Output

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR` | `$HOME/.prevoyant/reports` | Folder where PDF/HTML reports are saved. Created automatically if it does not exist. |

### Email Delivery (optional)

Set `PRX_EMAIL_TO` to enable. Leave it unset to disable email entirely.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PRX_EMAIL_TO` | — | Recipient address |
| `PRX_SMTP_HOST` | If email set | SMTP hostname — `smtp.gmail.com` / `smtp.office365.com` |

| `PRX_SMTP_USER` | If email set | SMTP login username |
| `PRX_SMTP_PASS` | If email set | SMTP password or app password |

> **Gmail:** Use an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) when 2-Step Verification is enabled.

### Bryan — Scrum Master (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED` | `N` | Set to `Y` to activate Bryan's retrospective (Step 14 / R10). Disabled by default. |
| `PRX_SKILL_UPGRADE_MIN_SESSIONS` | `3` | Sessions with an approved change before Bryan pushes to the plugin repo's main branch. Set to `1` to push after every approved session. |
| `PRX_SKILL_COMPACTION_INTERVAL` | `10` | Sessions between full SKILL.md compaction passes. On compaction sessions Bryan deep-reviews the entire file to eliminate redundancy and compress verbose prose; requires all five team members to approve. |
| `PRX_MONTHLY_BUDGET` | `20.00` | Monthly Claude subscription budget in USD. Actual spend is measured via [codeburn](https://github.com/getagentseal/codeburn), which reads Claude Code's local JSONL logs — no network call, no auth. Checked at every session start; Bryan uses the real figure in Step 14. Flags ⚠️ at >80% and ❌ at ≥100%. Budget resets on the 1st of each month. |

### Intelligence Workers (optional)

These workers run autonomously in the background and feed the knowledge-buildup queue consumed by Step 13j (and KB Review Mode).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_KBFLOW_ENABLED` | `Y` | Set to `Y` to enable the KB Flow Analyst worker. Queries Jira for recent incidents, traces the highest-impact business flows in the codebase, and writes proposed CMM updates to `~/.prevoyant/knowledge-buildup/kbflow-pending.md`. Consumed by Step 13j. |

### Cortex Intelligence Layer (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_CORTEX_ENABLED` | `Y` (default) | Enables the Cortex layer. Distils the KB into 9 curated fact files (architecture, business-rules, patterns, decisions, hotspots, glossary, observations, autonomy-queue, session-memory) read by agents at Step 0. |
| `PRX_CORTEX_AUTONOMY_LEVEL` | `2` | `0` — disabled (no auto-promotion). `1` — tracking only (builds LMDB observation store, no promotion). `2` — confidence-gated: LMDB observations with ≥3 confirmations and ≥2-day age are queued for KB promotion after a 24 h review window. `3` — fully automatic (no review window). |
| `PRX_CORTEX_AUTO_PROMOTE_THRESHOLD` | `3` | Number of cross-session confirmations required before an LMDB observation is queued for auto-promotion (level 2+). |
| `PRX_CORTEX_AUTO_PROMOTE_DELAY_HOURS` | `24` | Hours in the review window before a queued observation is actually promoted to KB (level 2+). |
| `PRX_CORTEX_AUTO_PROMOTE_MIN_AGE_DAYS` | `2` | Minimum observation age in days before it is eligible for auto-promotion (level 2+). |

### Automation (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTO_MODE` | `N` | Set to `Y` to run the full workflow without any interactive prompts, confirmation gates, or permission asks. The fix is proposed and automatically applied to the newly created feature branch. |
| `FORCE_FULL_RUN` | `N` | Set to `Y` to force every step to execute in full even when the ticket has been analysed in a prior session. Useful when replaying a ticket for a completely fresh analysis. |

### Output Verbosity (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_REPORT_VERBOSITY` | `full` | Controls how much panel dialogue appears in the terminal. `full` — all panel dialogue, debate rounds, check-ins. `compact` — structured blocks intact; narrative condensed to bullets. `minimal` — structured blocks only; no panel narrative. The PDF report always contains full content regardless of this setting. |

### Jira Project Scope (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_JIRA_PROJECT` | — | Jira project key to scope ticket polling (e.g. `IV`). When set, `poll-jira.sh` restricts the JQL to that project only. Omit to poll all projects assigned to `currentUser()`. |

### Attachment Size Limit (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_ATTACHMENT_MAX_MB` | `0` (no limit) | Maximum size in MB for non-image attachments (logs, dumps, XML, etc.). Set to `0` or leave unset for no limit. Images and screenshots are always read regardless of this setting. |

### Webhook Server — Ambient Agent (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `WEBHOOK_PORT` | `3000` | Port the Express server listens on. |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | — | Token appended to the webhook URL registered in Jira: `http://your-server:3000/jira-events?token=YOUR_SECRET`. Leave empty to skip token validation (only safe on a private network). |
| `WEBHOOK_POLL_INTERVAL_DAYS` | `0` (disabled) | Run `poll-jira.sh` every N days as the primary cron trigger. Cron is the default heartbeat; the Jira webhook accelerates real-time delivery on top of it. Set to `0` to disable. Fractional values work: `0.5` = every 12 hours. |

### Hermes Integration (optional)

Connects Prevoyant to a local [Hermes](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent) gateway for multi-platform notifications, persistent cross-session memory, and unified webhook routing. See [Hermes Integration](#hermes-integration-1) for full setup instructions.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED` | `N` | Set to `Y` to activate Hermes mode. Hermes becomes the front door for all Jira/GitHub events; Prevoyant exposes `POST /internal/enqueue` instead of `POST /jira-events`. Requires server restart. |
| `PRX_HERMES_GATEWAY_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Base URL of the Hermes gateway process. Prevoyant POSTs job results here so Hermes can deliver them to Telegram, Slack, Discord, etc. |
| `PRX_HERMES_SECRET` | — | Shared secret Hermes must send in the `X-Hermes-Secret` header when calling `/internal/enqueue`. Leave blank to skip validation (trusted network only). |

### P2P KB Sync + Collective Intelligence Mesh

Peer-to-peer knowledge-base propagation via libp2p — the primary KB sync mechanism. The server starts a libp2p node that discovers peers via mDNS (LAN) and public bootstrap nodes, then broadcasts KB changes directly over GossipSub. No external service or account required.

When `PRX_CORTEX_P2P_ENABLED=Y`, extends into the **Collective Intelligence Mesh**: every node's Cortex observations are broadcast across all connected nodes, confirmed by cross-node evidence, and auto-promoted to KB when consensus thresholds are met. New nodes joining the mesh instantly inherit the accumulated intelligence of all connected nodes via the `/prevoyant/cortex-query/1` stream protocol.

→ **[Full documentation: docs/P2P.md](docs/P2P.md)**

All three tiers are **active by default** on a fresh install: `PRX_P2P_ENABLED=Y` (KB sync), `PRX_CORTEX_ENABLED=Y` (intelligence layer), and `PRX_CORTEX_P2P_ENABLED=Y` (mesh). Set any to `N` to disable.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_P2P_ENABLED` | `Y` | Set to `Y` to start the libp2p node and enable P2P KB sync. Hot-toggled from Settings — no restart required. |
| `PRX_P2P_PORT` | `7001` | TCP port the libp2p node listens on. Must be open and reachable by peers. |
| `PRX_P2P_MDNS_ENABLED` | `Y` | Set to `Y` to enable mDNS LAN peer discovery. Disable on networks where mDNS is blocked. |
| `PRX_P2P_BOOTSTRAP_NODES` | — | Comma-separated list of bootstrap node multiaddrs for WAN peer discovery, e.g. `/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/7001/p2p/<peerId>`. Leave blank to rely on mDNS only. |
| `PRX_P2P_SECRET` | `LetMeInPrevoyant@2026` | HMAC-SHA256 shared secret used to authenticate every GossipSub message. Change this before sharing the setup with teammates. |
| `PRX_P2P_RECONCILE_MINS` | `60` | Interval in minutes between full reconciliation syncs (delta sync on change is immediate). |
| `PRX_P2P_ENCRYPT` | `N` | Set to `Y` to encrypt KB file content with AES-256-GCM (key derived from `PRX_P2P_SECRET`) before sending. Peers without the same secret receive unreadable ciphertext. |
| `PRX_P2P_TRICKLE` | `N` | Set to `Y` to enable trickle mode: files are sent in small adaptive batches rather than one bulk message. Batch size and inter-batch delay self-adjust based on measured network RTT (1–10 files/batch, 100 ms–10 s delay). Default `N` is bulk mode. |
| `PRX_P2P_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY` | — | PEM-encoded RSA-2048 private key for future per-peer key exchange. Generate from Settings → P2P KB Sync using the in-browser Web Crypto API. Stored as a single-line `"\n"`-escaped value in `.env`. |
| `PRX_P2P_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY` | — | PEM-encoded RSA-2048 public key corresponding to `PRX_P2P_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`. |

**Collective Intelligence Mesh** (`PRX_CORTEX_P2P_ENABLED=Y` — requires Tier 1 above):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_CORTEX_P2P_ENABLED` | `Y` | Set to `Y` to enable the Collective Intelligence Mesh. Broadcasts Cortex observations across nodes; new nodes inherit the network's full observation cache on first connect. Requires `PRX_P2P_ENABLED=Y` and `PRX_CORTEX_ENABLED=Y`. |
| `PRX_CORTEX_QUERY_ENABLED` | `Y` | Expose `GET /dashboard/cortex/network/query` for agent Layer 0c queries. |
| `PRX_CORTEX_P2P_CONSENSUS_PROMOTE_PCT` | `0` | Minimum % of connected peers that must have confirmed an observation before it can auto-promote to KB. `0` disables the peer-consensus gate (local `PRX_CORTEX_AUTO_PROMOTE_THRESHOLD` still applies). |

> `PRX_KB_SYNC_TRIGGER`, `PRX_KB_SYNC_MACHINE`, and `PRX_KB_SYNC_DEBOUNCE_SECS` are read by the P2P worker to control outbound sync behaviour.

### Notifications (optional)

Set `PRX_NOTIFY_ENABLED=Y` to enable. Requires `PRX_EMAIL_TO` to be set.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_NOTIFY_ENABLED` | `N` | Set to `Y` to enable email notifications for ticket lifecycle events. |

| `PRX_NOTIFY_MUTE_DAYS` | `0` | Temporarily mute all notifications for N days. |
| `PRX_NOTIFY_MUTE_UNTIL` | — | Internal — set by the mute command. Do not edit manually. |
| `PRX_NOTIFY_EVENTS` | all events | Comma-separated list of events to notify on: `jira_assigned`, `ticket_scheduled`, `ticket_queued`, `ticket_started`, `ticket_completed`, `ticket_failed`, `ticket_interrupted`, `poll_ran`. |

### WhatsApp Notifications (optional — via WaSenderAPI)

Sends concise WhatsApp messages for ticket lifecycle events. PDF reports are also delivered as WhatsApp documents. Requires a [WaSenderAPI](https://wasenderapi.com) account (free 3-day trial, from $6/month). Uses Node's built-in `https` — no new npm dependencies.

Set `PRX_WASENDER_ENABLED=Y` to activate. All fields are also editable from Settings → WhatsApp Notifications.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_WASENDER_ENABLED` | `N` | Set to `Y` to enable WhatsApp notifications. |
| `PRX_WASENDER_API_KEY` | — | Session-specific API key from your WaSenderAPI dashboard (Settings → Sessions → API Key). |
| `PRX_WASENDER_TO` | — | Recipient WhatsApp number with country code, e.g. `+23052xxxxxxx`. |
| `PRX_WASENDER_PUBLIC_URL` | — | Public base URL of this server, e.g. `https://yourserver.com`. Required for PDF report delivery — WaSenderAPI fetches the document from `{PRX_WASENDER_PUBLIC_URL}/dashboard/reports/serve/{filename}`. Omit to disable document sending (text notifications still work). |
| `PRX_WASENDER_EVENTS` | all events | Comma-separated list of events that trigger a WhatsApp message. Leave blank to send on all events. Independent of `PRX_NOTIFY_EVENTS`. |

**Supported events:** `jira_assigned`, `ticket_queued`, `ticket_started`, `ticket_completed`, `ticket_failed`, `ticket_interrupted`, `ticket_scheduled`, `poll_ran`, `stage_dev_root_cause`, `stage_dev_fix`, `stage_dev_impact`, `stage_dev_report`, `stage_review_panel`, `stage_review_report`, `stage_est_final`, `stage_est_report`, `watch_poll_completed`, `watch_poll_failed`, `watch_completed`.

**Messages are brief one-liners with emoji** — e.g. `✅ IV-3804 complete`, `📄 IV-3804 dev report ready`, `👁 IV-3804 watch digest sent`. Report events (`stage_dev_report`, `stage_review_report`, `stage_est_report`) additionally send the PDF as a WhatsApp document when `PRX_WASENDER_PUBLIC_URL` is configured.

### Health Monitor — Watchdog (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_WATCHDOG_ENABLED` | `N` | Set to `Y` to enable the in-process watchdog. Polls `GET /health` and sends an urgent email alert when the server stops responding; sends a recovery email when it comes back. Requires `PRX_EMAIL_TO`. |
| `PRX_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_SECS` | `60` | Seconds between health checks. |

### Disk Monitor (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_DISK_MONITOR_ENABLED` | `N` | Set to `Y` to enable disk space tracking for `~/.prevoyant/`. Sends an email alert when the folder reaches `PRX_DISK_CAPACITY_ALERT_PCT`% of `PRX_PREVOYANT_MAX_SIZE_MB`. Cleanup must be approved via the dashboard — no automatic deletion. |
| `PRX_DISK_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MINS` | `60` | Minutes between disk checks. |
| `PRX_PREVOYANT_MAX_SIZE_MB` | `500` | Size quota for `~/.prevoyant/` in MB. The alert threshold is a percentage of this value. |
| `PRX_DISK_CAPACITY_ALERT_PCT` | `80` | Percentage of the size quota at which to send an alert email. E.g. 80% of 500 MB = alert fires at 400 MB. |
| `PRX_DISK_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_DAYS` | `7` | Days between cleanup passes (surfaces a pending-cleanup notice on the dashboard). |

### Ticket Watcher (optional)

Continuously monitors Jira tickets on a configurable schedule and emails AI-generated progress digests. Manage watched tickets at `/dashboard/watch`.

Set `PRX_WATCH_ENABLED=Y` to activate.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|

| `PRX_WATCH_POLL_INTERVAL` | `1d` | Default interval pre-selected when adding a ticket: `1h`, `1d`, `2d`, or `5d`. |
| `PRX_WATCH_MAX_POLLS` | `0` | Default maximum polls per ticket when adding (0 = unlimited). |
| `PRX_WATCH_LOG_KEEP_DAYS` | `30` | Delete poll log files older than this many days during disk cleanup. |
| `PRX_WATCH_LOG_KEEP_PER_TICKET` | `10` | Keep at most this many log files per ticket (oldest removed first) during disk cleanup. |

Poll logs are written to `~/.prevoyant/watch/logs/{TICKET_KEY}/` — one timestamped file per poll. The live log tail is available from the Watch dashboard while a poll is in flight.

### Claude Budget Tracker (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRX_MONTHLY_BUDGET` | — | Monthly budget in USD. The dashboard tracks spend against this limit using codeburn local token calculation (labelled "codeburn calc'd"). |

---

## Prerequisites

Run the setup script — it auto-detects your OS and handles everything below. Manual commands are listed here as a fallback only.

### PDF Generation

The skill generates reports via pandoc → Chrome headless → HTML fallback (tried in order, first success wins).

**pandoc (best output quality):**

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| macOS | `brew install pandoc` |
| Linux | `sudo apt install pandoc` / `sudo dnf install pandoc` |
| Windows | `winget install JohnMacFarlane.Pandoc` |
| Manual | [pandoc.org/installing.html](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) |

**Chrome headless:** no setup needed if Chrome is already installed.

**HTML fallback:** saves a styled `.html` file — open in any browser and print to PDF.

### Node.js + codeburn (token budget tracking)

`npx` (bundled with Node.js) runs [codeburn](https://github.com/getagentseal/codeburn) to measure actual Claude token spend. **codeburn is installed globally by `setup.sh`** and falls back to `npx --yes codeburn@latest` on first use. Node.js itself must be present.

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| macOS | `brew install node` or [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Linux | `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x \| sudo -E bash - && sudo apt install -y nodejs` |
| Windows | `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` or [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |

> If Node.js is not installed, budget tracking is silently skipped and the skill falls back to manual token estimation. No other functionality is affected.

### uvx (Jira MCP)

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| macOS / Linux | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |
| Windows | `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 \| iex"` |

### ast-grep (optional — structural code search)

`ast-grep` (`sg`) enhances Step 5 code location with syntax-aware search — it matches Java class hierarchies, method calls, and overrides by AST structure rather than text, eliminating grep false positives from comments and string literals. The skill falls back to pure grep if `sg` is not installed.

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| macOS | `brew install ast-grep` |
| Linux / Windows WSL | `cargo install ast-grep` (requires Rust) or download a binary from [github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep/releases](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep/releases) |

Verify: `sg --version`

### graphify (auto-installed — codebase knowledge graph)

[graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) is installed automatically by `scripts/setup.sh` / `scripts/setup.ps1` and produces `graph.json` + `GRAPH_REPORT.md` at the root of `PRX_REPO_DIR`. The dev skill uses it as Pass 0 of Step 5 (Locate Affected Code) for instant symbol lookups, for the KB stale-anchor sweep at Step 0a (graph-aware `RELOCATED`/`STALE` detection), and for the KB coverage audit (god-node gaps and surprising cross-module connections are staged into `kbflow-pending.md` for Sam's Step 13j review). All graph-aware paths fall back to grep/ast-grep when the graph is absent.

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| macOS / Linux / Windows | `uv tool install graphifyy` (preferred — installed automatically by setup) |
| Fallback (any OS)       | `pipx install graphifyy` |

Verify: `graphify --version`. If `graphify` is not on PATH after install, run `uv tool update-shell` (or `pipx ensurepath`) and reopen the shell.

### Git
The repository at `REPO_DIR` must be present locally. The skill creates branches there.

### P2P KB Sync — libp2p prerequisites (`PRX_P2P_ENABLED=Y` only)

The Prevoyant Server's P2P layer uses [js-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p) with TCP transport, Noise encryption, Yamux multiplexing, GossipSub, and mDNS peer discovery. Most packages are pure JavaScript, but `lmdb` (used by the Cortex layer) ships prebuilt native binaries and falls back to compilation if no matching prebuilt exists.

#### Native build tools (needed only if prebuilt binaries are absent)

| Platform | When needed | How to install |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **macOS** | Non-standard arch or prebuilt mismatch | `xcode-select --install` |
| **Linux** | Missing `cc`, `make`, or `python3` | `sudo apt install -y build-essential python3` (Debian/Ubuntu)<br>`sudo dnf groupinstall 'Development Tools' && sudo dnf install python3` (RHEL/Fedora) |
| **Windows** | Prebuilt binary unavailable (rare on x64) | `winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools`<br>or install VS 2019/2022 with **Desktop development with C++**<br>or `npm install --global windows-build-tools` (Node 16-era fallback) |

> **In practice**: lmdb ships prebuilt binaries for macOS x64/arm64, Linux x64/arm64, and Windows x64. Build tools are only needed if your platform falls outside these targets. If `npm install` in `server/` fails with `gyp ERR! build error`, install the tools for your platform above and retry.

#### Firewall — TCP port for peer connectivity

Peers on other machines reach your node on `PRX_P2P_PORT` (default `7001`). Open this port before expecting WAN peers.

**macOS:**
```
System Settings → Firewall → Options → allow incoming connections for node
```
Or temporarily disable the firewall for testing (not recommended in production).

**Linux (ufw):**
```bash
sudo ufw allow 7001/tcp
```

**Linux (firewalld):**
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=7001/tcp && sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

**Windows (PowerShell — run as Administrator):**
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Prevoyant P2P" -Direction Inbound `
  -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 7001 -Action Allow
```

> Substitute `7001` with your actual `PRX_P2P_PORT` value if you changed it.

#### mDNS LAN discovery — platform notes

mDNS (used for automatic peer discovery on the local network) has platform-specific requirements:

| Platform | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **macOS** | Works out of the box via Bonjour. No extra setup needed. |
| **Linux** | Works if port 5353 UDP is not blocked. Some corporate firewalls block mDNS — disable `PRX_P2P_MDNS_ENABLED` and use `PRX_P2P_BOOTSTRAP_NODES` for WAN-only setups. |
| **Windows** | Requires the network adapter profile to be set to **Private** (not Public). Public profile blocks multicast. Fix:<br>`Settings → Network → [adapter] → Properties → Private network`<br>or PowerShell: `Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceAlias (Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object Status -eq Up | Select-Object -First 1).Name -NetworkCategory Private` |

> If mDNS doesn't discover peers, set `PRX_P2P_BOOTSTRAP_NODES` with the multiaddr of at least one known peer and disable `PRX_P2P_MDNS_ENABLED=N`. The server dashboard shows live peer count so you can verify discovery is working.

---

## Knowledge Base

Every session feeds into a **shared, persistent knowledge base** stored as plain Markdown files. The KB grows richer after every ticket — capturing business rules, root causes, recurring patterns, and regression risks.

### Storage modes

| Mode | Location | Distribution | Encryption |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **local** (default) | `$HOME/.prevoyant/knowledge-base/` | None — private to one machine | None |
| **distributed** | Local clone of `PRX_KB_REPO` | Via git push/pull to your team's private repo | Optional AES-256-CBC |

**Local mode:** zero setup — the KB is created automatically on the first session.

**Distributed mode:** share the KB across your team via a private git repository you own.

```bash
# Set in your shell profile or .env:
export PRX_KB_MODE=distributed
export PRX_KB_REPO="git@github.com:myorg/team-kb.git"
# Optional — default is $HOME/.prevoyant/kb:
export PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE="$HOME/.prevoyant/kb"
```

The skill clones the repo and initialises the directory structure automatically on the first session.

**Optional encryption** (defense-in-depth — useful if company policy requires data encrypted at rest):
```bash
export PRX_KB_KEY="your-strong-secret-passphrase"
```
Never commit `PRX_KB_KEY`. Share it with teammates through a secure channel (1Password, secrets manager, etc.).

    └── bob.md
```

In `KB_MODE=distributed` all files on disk are `.md.enc`; the plain `.md` files exist only in a temp working directory during the session.

**Knowledge-buildup working files** live *outside* the KB tree at `~/.prevoyant/knowledge-buildup/` and are never committed to the KB repo:

| File | Written by | Consumed by |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `kbflow-pending.md` | KB Flow Analyst (Javed worker) | Step 13j — Sam chairs panel vote; approved entries written to `core-mental-map/` |
| `kbflow-sessions.md` | KB Flow Analyst | Run log only — not consumed by skill steps |

`INDEX.md` holds two sections:
- **Memory Palace** — vivid trigger phrases mapped to system rooms; primary retrieval (≤ 3 reads regardless of KB size)
- **Master Index** — flat table greppable by ticket key, component, label, and trigger; fallback if Palace has no match

#### Folder purposes

| Folder | Driven by | What it contains |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| `shared/` | Tickets | Root causes, business rules, patterns, regression risks, process efficiency log |
| `core-mental-map/` | Codebase | Architecture, data flows, tech stack, gotchas (compressed facts) |
| `personas/memory/` | Sessions | Each agent's personal memory — observations, calibration, surprises — one file per session per agent |
| `lessons-learned/` | Developers | Per-person sprint retrospective entries: pitfalls and hard-won insights |
| `~/.prevoyant/knowledge-buildup/` *(outside KB tree)* | KB Flow Analyst | Buildup queue (`kbflow-pending.md`) + run log — never committed to the KB repo |

Every session starts by reading relevant `core-mental-map/` sections, all `lessons-learned/` files, and the last five personal memory files for each agent. Agents emit `[CMM+]` markers for codebase facts and `[LL+]` markers for lessons; both are written back to the KB at the end of every session. Each agent also writes a personal memory file (Step 13i) capturing what they observed, predicted, and got surprised by — so agents get sharper with every session they participate in.

### Lessons Learned

Each developer keeps a personal file at `lessons-learned/{name}.md`. Entries are written in two ways:

- **Manually** — after a sprint retrospective or investigation, append an entry directly to your file using the format below.
- **Automatically** — agents emit `[LL+]` markers during investigation; these are appended to the current developer's file at session end (Step 13h).

```markdown
## LL-001 — {short title}
date: 2026-04-14 | sprint: Sprint 42 | ticket: PROJ-1234
PITFALL: {the trap to avoid — specific and actionable}
KEY: {the corrective rule in one line}
ref: {file:line or "—"}
```

The developer identity is resolved from `$PRX_DEVELOPER_NAME` (if set) or `git config user.name`. Agents read all developer files at session start and surface matching entries in the Prior Knowledge block so future sessions know which pitfalls to avoid.

### Multi-developer usage

In distributed mode, the skill runs `git pull --rebase` before every push. `INDEX.md` is fully rebuilt from `tickets/*.md` and `shared/*.md` after every pull, eliminating merge conflicts. A `.gitattributes` union merge strategy is applied to all KB files so concurrent pushes are automatically reconciled.

---

## Automated Polling (optional)

`scripts/poll-jira.sh` polls Jira every hour for tickets assigned to you with status **To Do**, **Open**, **Parked**, or **Blocked**, and triggers Prevoyant automatically for any new ones.

### Credentials file

Copy and fill in `scripts/.jira-credentials.example`:
```bash
cp scripts/.jira-credentials.example scripts/.jira-credentials
chmod 600 scripts/.jira-credentials
```

```bash
# .jira-credentials
JIRA_URL="https://yourcompany.atlassian.net"
JIRA_USER="firstname.lastname@yourcompany.com"
JIRA_TOKEN="your-api-token-here"
```

### Schedule

**macOS — launchd:**
```bash
# Edit the plist — replace /Users/YOUR_USERNAME with your home path
cp scripts/com.prevoyant.poll-jira.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.prevoyant.poll-jira.plist
launchctl list | grep com.prevoyant.poll-jira
```

Enable **Power Nap** (System Settings → Battery → Options) so the job fires while the lid is closed.

**Linux — cron:**
```bash
crontab -e
# Add:
0 * * * * DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u)/bus /bin/bash $HOME/prevoyant/scripts/poll-jira.sh
```

**Windows — Task Scheduler (WSL):**
1. Open Task Scheduler → Create Basic Task
2. Trigger: Daily, repeat every 1 hour
3. Action: Program = `wsl`, Arguments = `bash /home/<wsl-user>/prevoyant/scripts/poll-jira.sh`

### Headless mode

When triggered by the polling script, `AUTO_MODE=true` is set and all interactive confirmation gates are bypassed with safe defaults. Branch creation and file edits are skipped — the skill runs the full analysis and saves the PDF. The developer reviews the PDF and applies the fix manually.

### Test manually
```bash
bash scripts/poll-jira.sh
tail -20 scripts/poll-jira.log
```

## Prevoyant Server

An optional Node.js service that runs alongside the plugin as an always-on ambient agent. It receives Jira webhook events, queues tickets for analysis, spawns Claude, and surfaces live progress on a web dashboard — so tickets are processed automatically the moment they land in your queue, with no manual invocation needed.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Webhook receiver** — accepts Jira webhook events and auto-queues assigned tickets
- **Pipeline dashboard** — live job queue with stop/kill, session history, cost tracking (30-day sparkline), and PDF report viewer
- **Cortex intelligence layer** — always-on, self-updating distillation of the KB into 9 curated fact files; backed by a 3-tier fast memory store (LRU hot cache → LMDB mmap disk store → JSONL fallback) for sub-millisecond reads and crash-proof persistence; agents read the facts in Step 0 instead of trawling raw KB files. Autonomy level 2 (confidence-gated): LMDB observations with ≥3 confirmations and ≥2-day age are queued for auto-promotion after a 24 h review window. **→ [docs/CORTEX.md](docs/CORTEX.md)**
- **KB Flow Analyst** — autonomous background worker that queries Jira for recent incidents, identifies the highest-impact business flows, traces them in the codebase, and proposes Core Mental Map updates to `~/.prevoyant/knowledge-buildup/kbflow-pending.md` for team vote at Step 13j; manageable via the Knowledge Builder dashboard page
- **Health watchdog** — polls `/health` on a configurable interval and emails on DOWN/UP transitions
- **Ticket watcher** — monitors watched Jira tickets and sends digest alerts on status changes
- **Disk monitor** — tracks `~/.prevoyant/` disk usage against a configurable quota; alerts at threshold and runs periodic cleanup (sessions, server logs, watch logs, KB Flow Analyst run logs)
- **Update checker** — polls GitHub for new plugin releases and surfaces an upgrade prompt on the dashboard
- **WhatsApp notifications** — sends ticket and report events via WaSender API (zero new dependencies)
- **P2P KB sync + Collective Intelligence Mesh** — libp2p transport layer (TCP · Noise · Yamux · GossipSub) for direct machine-to-machine KB propagation; active by default; supports trickle mode, AES-256-GCM encryption, mDNS LAN discovery, and RSA-2048 node identity. When `PRX_CORTEX_P2P_ENABLED=Y`, extends into a Collective Intelligence Mesh: Cortex observations are broadcast across all connected nodes, confirmed by cross-node evidence, and auto-promoted to KB when consensus thresholds are met — new nodes inherit the full network's accumulated intelligence on first connect. Dashboard shows live peer count, animated mesh topology, and sync counters. **→ [docs/P2P.md](docs/P2P.md)**
- **Agent memory index** — JSON file-based index (`~/.prevoyant/memory/index.json`) for KB query enrichment; zero-dependency, zero-setup
- **Session persistence** — state survives server restarts; automatic PDF report discovery

**Running it 24/7:** the server is designed to run continuously. A macOS launchd plist (`scripts/com.prevoyant.server.plist`) and Linux systemd unit (`scripts/prevoyant-server.service`) are provided for auto-start and crash restart.

## What It Does — Step Reference

### Dev Mode (12 steps)

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **0** | Initialise KB; pull latest if distributed; query by components/labels; present Prior Knowledge block |
| **1** | Fetch the Jira issue (13 fields: summary, type, priority, status, assignee, reporter, labels, components, versions, description, comments, attachments) |
| **2** | Analyse description + all linked tickets + attachments → problem statement, acceptance criteria, optional draw.io diagram |
| **3** | Read all comments → extract prior investigation findings, decisions, constraints |
| **4** | Create feature branch (`Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_{Title}`) from the correct base (fix version → affected version → `development`) |
| **5** | Locate affected code via grep-first/read-second approach → file map with confidence gate |
| **6** | Write numbered reproduction steps with prerequisites, expected vs actual, service restart guidance |
| **7** | Root cause analysis: **Engineering Panel** (bug) — Morgan chairs; Alex, Sam, Jordan investigate; Henk checks business necessity and client value (step 7h-ii); Riley assesses test coverage; scored verdict + Root Cause Statement. **Direct analysis** (enhancement) — Enhancement Statement |
| **8** | Propose fix anchored to Root Cause/Enhancement Statement; Morgan fix review (including Henk's client-value view); optional apply to branch |
| **9** | Impact analysis — usage reference search, layer-by-layer impact table, regression risks, retest checklist |
| **10** | Change summary — files touched, commit message, PR description template |
| **11** | Session stats — elapsed time, actual token usage and cost delta via codeburn (fallback: manual estimation) |
| **12** | Generate PDF report → save to `CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR`; email if `PRX_EMAIL_TO` is set |
| **13** | Write session record to KB; push if distributed |
| **13j** | Sam reviews KB Flow Analyst proposals (`kbflow-pending.md`) — unanimous panel vote; approved entries written to `core-mental-map/` |

### PR Review Mode (10 steps)

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **R0** | KB initialise + query |
| **R1** | Fetch Jira ticket |
| **R2** | Full problem understanding including all linked tickets |
| **R3** | Read comments |
| **R4** | Locate feature branch (`Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_*`), run `git diff` to retrieve full changeset |
| **R5** | Engineering Panel code review — same team as Dev Mode; Alex (code quality), Sam (logic + acceptance criteria), Jordan (20-pattern defensive checklist), Henk (business rule alignment + client-value impact), Riley (test coverage); Morgan scores and delivers binding verdict |
| **R6** | Consolidated findings — Critical/Major/Minor issues with `file:line`, fix recommendations, Positives, Conditions for Approval |
| **R7** | Session stats — same as Step 11 (codeburn actual data, fallback: estimation) |
| **R8** | PDF review report |
| **R9** | Update KB with review findings; push if distributed |

**Review verdict:** ✅ APPROVED / ⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / 🔄 REQUEST CHANGES / ❌ REJECT

### Estimate Mode (9 steps)

Story points = **Complexity + Risk + Repetition** (not hours). Scale: 1 · 2 · 3 · 5 · 8 · 13 · 20 · ? Each engineer votes through their domain lens, explicitly citing KB and system knowledge.

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **E0** | KB & system knowledge load — pull KB; each engineer reads `core-mental-map/` (architecture, gotchas, data-flows), `shared/patterns.md` `[ESTIMATE-PATTERN]` entries, past ticket `## Estimation` records, and `lessons-learned/` for the affected components |
| **E1** | Ingest ticket — fetch all Jira fields and acceptance criteria; surface existing story points as context only (no anchoring) |
| **E2** | Scope & dimension analysis — Engineering Panel jointly maps work areas and rates Complexity / Risk / Repetition with KB evidence; spike gate (critical unknowns) and split gate (4+ high-effort areas) applied before voting |
| **E3** | Planning Poker Round 1 — simultaneous vote on 1·2·3·5·8·13·20·?; each panel member scores all three dimensions through their domain lens (Morgan: architecture; Alex: backend; Sam: business logic; Jordan: infra/security; Henk: business rules and client workflows; Riley: testing) citing specific KB entries |
| **E4** | Debate & consensus — rounds anchored to dimensions: highest voter names which dimension is underweighted and cites system evidence; lowest responds with counter-evidence; others react and re-vote; up to 3 rounds |
| **E5** | Final estimate — story points, dimension summary (C/R/R), confidence (High/Medium/Low), key assumptions, what would change the estimate |
| **E6** | KB update — records estimate with full dimension breakdown in `tickets/{KEY}.md`; appends `[ESTIMATE-PATTERN]` to `shared/patterns.md` if a reusable complexity insight was found |
| **E7** | Bryan's retrospective — audits whether votes were grounded in KB evidence or gut feel; proposes estimation workflow improvements (opt-in) |

### KB Review Mode (3 stages) — `/prevoyant:dev kb review`

Standalone mode with no Jira ticket. Processes the KB Flow Analyst queue.

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **KR0** | Count pending entries in `kbflow-pending.md`; skip if empty |
| **KR1** | Step 13j — Sam chairs unanimous panel vote on KB Flow Analyst proposals; approved entries written to `core-mental-map/` |
| **KR2** | Completion block — reports counts promoted and skipped |

All skill logic lives in `plugin/skills/dev/SKILL.md`. No compiled code, no runtime dependencies beyond what Claude Code provides.

> **Jira MCP:** `.mcp.json` is committed to this repo and already configured. It tells Claude Code to run `uvx mcp-atlassian`. You never need to edit it — credentials come from `.env` automatically.

> **Settings:** `.claude/settings.json` (committed) holds the shared `SessionStart` hooks that load `.env` and check the monthly budget — every developer gets these automatically on clone. `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) holds per-machine permission approvals generated by the setup script. Any `Bash` permission entries referencing `SKILL.md` should use the relative path `plugin/skills/dev/SKILL.md` — not an absolute path — so the config works on any machine.

---

## Contributing

### Make changes

All skill logic is in one file:
```
plugin/skills/dev/SKILL.md
```

Edit this file to modify workflow steps, prompts, or project context.

### SKILL.md change history

Every change Bryan approves and pushes is recorded in two places:

| Where | What it contains |
|-------|-----------------|
| `## Skill Change Log` table at the top of `SKILL.md` | One row per change: SC#, version, date, git commit hash, type, summary, status — visible to anyone reading the file |
| `shared/skill-changelog.md` in the KB | Full detail: verbatim before/after wording, backlog ref, voter record, and revert status |

To **revert a Bryan change** that caused a regression:
```bash
# 1. Find the commit hash in the Skill Change Log table or skill-changelog.md
git log --oneline | grep "Bryan SC-"

# 2. Safe revert — creates a new commit, no history rewrite
git revert <COMMIT_HASH>
git push origin main
```
Then append `[REVERTED: {date} — revert-commit: {hash} — reason: ...]` to the matching `[SC-NNN]` entry in `skill-changelog.md`.

### Bump the version

When making a change, increment the version in **all three** files:

| File | Field |
|------|-------|
| `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `"version"` |
| `plugin/package.json` | `"version"` |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | `"version"` inside the `plugins` array |

Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org): PATCH (bug fix), MINOR (new feature), MAJOR (breaking change).

### Commit and push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "vX.Y.Z — short description"
git push origin main
```

### Update the plugin

After pushing, update your local installation:
```bash
claude plugin update prevoyant@dodogeny
```

> Do **not** run `git pull` directly inside `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/dodogeny` — Claude Code manages that directory.

---

## Hermes Integration

> **Full documentation:** [docs/hermes-integration.md](docs/hermes-integration.md)

[Hermes](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent) is an open-source autonomous agent by Nous Research that acts as the nervous system for Prevoyant — handling multi-platform notifications, persistent cross-session memory, unified webhook routing, and proactive scheduling, while Prevoyant remains the domain intelligence layer for Jira ticket analysis.

### Why Hermes?

Enabling `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y` upgrades Prevoyant from a scheduled analysis tool to a **full-time autonomous agent**:

| Capability | Without Hermes | With Hermes |
|---|---|---|
| **Trigger speed** | Cron poll every N days | Instant — Hermes fires on every Jira/GitHub event |
| **Notifications** | Email / WhatsApp only | Telegram, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, and more |
| **Memory** | Session-scoped only | Cross-session persistent memory in `~/.hermes/prevoyant-memory.jsonl` |
| **Scheduling** | Prevoyant's own cron | Hermes owns the schedule — smarter, event-driven |
| **Jira write-back** | Manual only | Auto-comment on ticket when analysis completes (`PRX_HERMES_JIRA_WRITEBACK=Y`) |
| **Installation** | Manual CLI install | Auto-installs Hermes CLI when `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y` |
| **Activity log** | Ticket events only | Full Hermes lifecycle events (install, gateway, results) visible in dashboard |
| **Revert** | — | Toggle off with `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=N` — no uninstall needed |

### Architecture

```

                            └── POST /prevoyant/result ──► Hermes
                                                              │
                                                   Telegram / Slack / Discord
```

**Without Hermes (`PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=N`, default):** Prevoyant operates standalone. Cron polling (`WEBHOOK_POLL_INTERVAL_DAYS`) is the primary trigger; the Jira webhook at `POST /jira-events` provides real-time acceleration on top.

**With Hermes (`PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y`):** Hermes becomes the front door. Prevoyant exposes `POST /internal/enqueue` for Hermes to hand off events. A one-time startup sweep still runs to catch tickets missed while the server was offline. Scheduling and notifications are owned by Hermes.

### SKILL.md compatibility

Hermes uses the same portable `SKILL.md` standard as Prevoyant. The file at `server/integrations/hermes/hermes-skill.md` tells Hermes how to invoke Prevoyant — what events to send, what payload format, and what the result callback looks like. Load it in Hermes with:

```bash
hermes skill install ./server/integrations/hermes/hermes-skill.md
```

### Quick setup

```bash
# 1. Install and configure Hermes (see https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent)
#    Then run the Prevoyant install script:
bash server/integrations/hermes/scripts/install.sh

# The script will:
#   - Set PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y in .env
#   - Configure PRX_HERMES_GATEWAY_URL and PRX_HERMES_SECRET
#   - Print the exact Hermes registration steps

# Or toggle from the dashboard: Settings → Hermes Integration
```

### What Hermes receives

When a Prevoyant job finishes, the server POSTs to `<PRX_HERMES_GATEWAY_URL>/prevoyant/result`:

```json
{
  "ticket_key": "PROJ-123",
  "status": "success",
  "mode": "dev",
  "cost_usd": 0.14,
  "completed_at": "2026-05-10T08:32:00.000Z"
}
```

Hermes uses this to send a push notification to the developer with the result summary.

### What Hermes sends

Hermes calls `POST /internal/enqueue` (authenticated by `X-Hermes-Secret`):

```json
{
  "ticket_key": "PROJ-123",
  "event_type": "jira.status.in_progress",
  "mode": "dev",
  "priority": "normal"
}
```

| Event type | Prevoyant mode |
|---|---|
| `jira.status.in_progress` | dev |
| `jira.issue_assigned` | dev |
| `jira.issue_created` | dev |
| `jira.pr.opened` | review |
| `jira.ticket.stale` | estimate |

### Telegram — full setup guide

Prevoyant ships with a built-in Telegram channel — no Hermes required. It works in two directions, controlled by two independent flags:

| Direction | Flag | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Outbound** (Prevoyant → you) | `PRX_TELEGRAM_ENABLED=Y` | Sends alerts: `🟢 Hermes gateway started`, `❌ PROJ-123 failed`, etc. |
| **Inbound** (you → Prevoyant) | `PRX_TELEGRAM_INBOUND_ENABLED=Y` | Accepts slash commands: `/dev PROJ-123`, `/queue`, `/status PROJ-123` |

You can run **outbound alone**, or **both directions** with the same bot token. Inbound requires outbound (replies need the `sendMessage` path).

> **Heads-up:** the inbound listener **auto-disables when `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y`**. Telegram delivers each message to exactly one consumer of `getUpdates`, so Hermes and Prevoyant can't both poll the same bot. If you want commands while running Hermes, either use a separate bot for Prevoyant, or let Hermes handle the chat.

---

#### Step 1 — Create a Telegram bot

1. In Telegram, open a chat with [**@BotFather**](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Send `/newbot`.
3. Pick a **display name** (e.g. `Prevoyant Bot`) and a **username** ending in `bot` (e.g. `prevoyant_alerts_bot`).
4. BotFather replies with your **bot token** — it looks like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ1234567890`. **Copy this**; it's the secret used in `PRX_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
5. *(Optional, recommended for groups)* If you'll add the bot to a group and want it to read all messages — not just commands — also send `/setprivacy` to BotFather, choose your bot, and select **Disable**. For the default Prevoyant flow, you can leave this alone: we only act on slash commands, and BotFather's default privacy mode already passes `/commands` through.

---

#### Step 2 — Find your chat ID

The chat ID is the **only chat from which inbound commands are accepted** (allowlist of one). Pick whichever flavour fits how you'll talk to the bot:

**Option A — Personal (DM to the bot, recommended for solo use)**

1. In Telegram, search for your bot's username and open a chat. Send any message (e.g. `hello`).
2. In a browser, visit:

   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR-TOKEN>/getUpdates
   ```

3. Find the first `"chat":{"id":<NUMBER>,...}` in the JSON response. That number (positive integer, e.g. `123456789`) is your `PRX_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.

**Option B — Quick lookup via a helper bot**

Chat with [**@userinfobot**](https://t.me/userinfobot) — it replies instantly with your numeric Telegram user ID, which is the same as your personal DM chat ID. Faster than fishing through `getUpdates` JSON.

**Option C — Group chat (you + teammates can issue commands)**

1. Create a Telegram group, add your bot as a member.
2. In the group, send `/start@<your-bot-username>` (or any message starting with `/`).
3. Visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` and look for `"chat":{"id":<NEGATIVE-NUMBER>,"type":"group",...}`. Group IDs are **negative**, e.g. `-1001234567890`. Use that as `PRX_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.

> **Tip:** if `getUpdates` returns `{"ok":true,"result":[]}`, you haven't sent a message *after* the bot was added. Send a fresh `/start` and refresh the URL.

---

#### Step 3 — Configure Prevoyant

Open **Dashboard → Hermes Config** (the Hermes badge in the topbar links there when Hermes is on; otherwise visit `/dashboard/hermes-config` directly), scroll to **Telegram Notifications**, and fill in:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Enable Telegram | `Y` |
| Bot Token | the token from BotFather |
| Chat ID | your chat ID from Step 2 |
| Notify on events | tick the events you want — leave all ticked for the full firehose, or untick e.g. `poll_ran` to quiet it down |
| Bi-directional commands | `Y` to accept slash commands; `N` for alerts-only |

Click **Save**. Settings take effect immediately — no restart.

---

#### Step 4 — Verify outbound

Hit **Send test message** in the Telegram Notifications panel. You should see:

> 🔔 **Prevoyant test message**
> Telegram notifications are working correctly.

land in your Telegram chat within ~1 second. If you don't:

- **`Telegram not enabled or missing token/chat ID`** — re-check the three fields above.
- **No message and no UI error** — most often a wrong chat ID (we posted to a chat the bot isn't in, so Telegram silently `403`s). Re-derive the chat ID via Step 2.

---

#### Step 5 — Verify inbound

If you turned on **Bi-directional commands**:

1. Watch the **Listener** badge under the Bi-directional commands row. Within ~1 second it should turn green: `Listener: running · offset <N>`.
   - If it shows **`Listener: off (Hermes mode)`** — that's the auto-disable kicking in. Either flip `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED` to `N`, or use a separate bot.
   - If it shows **`Listener: off — Bot token missing` / `Chat ID missing`** — save the fields and refresh.
2. In your Telegram chat with the bot, type `/help`. The slash-command menu should also be populated automatically (tap `/` in the message field to see it). Within ~1–25 seconds (long-poll latency), you'll get a reply listing the commands.
3. Try the real thing: `/dev PROJ-123` (replace with a real ticket key). You should see:

   > ✅ **PROJ-123** queued for **dev** mode

   …and the ticket will appear in the dashboard activity log with `source: telegram` and actor `telegram`.

---

#### Available commands

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `/dev <KEY>` | Queues a dev-mode analysis (root-cause + fix proposal) | `/dev PROJ-123` |
| `/review <KEY>` | Queues a PR review | `/review PROJ-456` |
| `/estimate <KEY>` | Queues a Planning Poker estimate | `/estimate PROJ-789` |
| `/status <KEY>` | Shows the current state of a ticket (queued / running / completed, mode, timestamps) | `/status PROJ-123` |
| `/queue` | Lists all active + queued tickets (max 15) | `/queue` |
| `/help` | Shows the menu | `/help` |

Commands work with the bot suffix too: `/dev@prevoyant_alerts_bot PROJ-123` — handy in groups where multiple bots are present.

Messages from any chat other than `PRX_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are silently dropped (and a debug line is written to `server/prevoyant-server.log` so you can see drops in real time).

---

#### Co-existence with Hermes

| Mode | Outbound (alerts) | Inbound (commands) |
|---|---|---|
| `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=N` (default) | ✅ Prevoyant → Telegram directly | ✅ Prevoyant listener handles slash commands |
| `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y` | ✅ Prevoyant → Telegram directly (still works) | 🚫 Prevoyant listener auto-disabled — Hermes owns the chat surface (and can do NL on top of it) |
| `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y` + separate bot for Prevoyant | ✅ Two bots, no conflict | ✅ Two bots, no conflict |

The "two bots" pattern is the right one if you want both Hermes's natural-language understanding **and** Prevoyant's deterministic slash commands.

---

#### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `401 Unauthorized` on `getUpdates` or `sendMessage` | Bot token is wrong / typo / extra whitespace | Re-paste the token from BotFather. The token format is `<numeric-id>:<35-char-string>`. |
| `Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request` in `prevoyant-server.log` | Another process (often Hermes, or a forgotten dev script) is also polling the same bot | Stop the other consumer, or use a different bot for Prevoyant. |
| `Forbidden: bot was blocked by the user` | You blocked the bot in Telegram | Open the chat in Telegram → top-right menu → Unblock. |
| Test message succeeds but `/dev` produces no reply | Listener isn't running (check the badge) | Toggle `PRX_TELEGRAM_INBOUND_ENABLED=Y`, save, watch the badge turn green. |
| Listener badge stays grey: `Listener: off — Chat ID missing` | Saved without a chat ID, or chat ID has stray whitespace | Re-enter the chat ID. Personal IDs are plain positive integers, group IDs start with `-100`. |
| Listener badge: `Listener: off (Hermes mode)` and you want both | `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y` blocks the listener | Either use Hermes for inbound (it speaks Telegram natively), or set up a second bot whose token only Prevoyant knows. |
| `/dev FOO-123` says "Invalid ticket key" | Key format must match `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*-\d+$` | Make sure the prefix is uppercase letters and there's a dash + number (e.g., `PROJ-1`, `ABC123_KEY-42`). |
| `/queue` always says "Queue is empty" even though jobs are running | The tracker hasn't recorded the ticket yet (jobs queued via legacy webhook before this feature shipped won't show their `source`) | New jobs will appear normally. Old jobs still complete, just don't list under `/queue`. |
| Replies take 1–25 seconds | That's the long-poll window | Normal. The next `getUpdates` call after your message replies almost instantly; if no traffic the cycle waits up to 25 s. |
| Server restart loses state | None — `~/.prevoyant/telegram-state.json` persists the last update ID | Restart freely; the listener resumes where it left off. |

**Where to look when something is wrong:** `server/prevoyant-server.log` filtered by `[telegram/listener]` shows every poll cycle, message receipt, ignored chat, dispatch result, and error.

---

#### Slack and Discord

These remain Hermes-side. With `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y`, the job result JSON is POSTed to the Hermes gateway, and Hermes fans it out to whichever platforms are configured in `~/.hermes/config.toml` — including Slack, Discord, Matrix, and email. Prevoyant doesn't ship built-in channels for those.

---

### Telegram + Hermes — worked examples

When `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y`, the chat surface shifts from Prevoyant's built-in slash-command listener to Hermes itself. Hermes is an LLM-driven agent, so it understands natural language and can interpret loose phrasing into the precise `POST /internal/enqueue` call Prevoyant expects. Here's how that looks in practice.

> **The flow at a glance:**
> ```
> Telegram → Hermes (interprets + routes) → POST /internal/enqueue → Prevoyant (queues, runs Claude Code)
>     ↑                                                                    │
>     └────── Hermes reply ←── poll /internal/jobs/recent-results ←────────┘
> ```

---

#### Example 1 — Loose natural-language analyse request

```
You (Telegram, 14:02):
  Hey, can you take a look at PROJ-1234? I'm seeing a 500 in prod.

Hermes (14:02):
  On it. Queuing dev-mode analysis for PROJ-1234 — I'll ping you when done.

  [Behind the scenes Hermes POSTs to Prevoyant:
   POST http://localhost:3000/internal/enqueue
   X-Hermes-Secret: <PRX_HERMES_SECRET>
   { "ticket_key": "PROJ-1234", "event_type": "jira.status.in_progress",
     "mode": "dev", "priority": "normal", "meta": { "source": "telegram",
     "user": "@you", "intent": "investigate 500" } }]

  ── 4 minutes pass; Hermes polls /internal/jobs/recent-results ──

Hermes (14:06):
  PROJ-1234 done ✅
  • Root cause: missing null-check in `authMiddleware.js:42` — undefined session
    when the cookie is malformed.
  • Fix proposal: 3 file changes (middleware + 2 tests). Branch:
    feature/PROJ-1234-fix-auth-nullcheck.
  • Cost: $0.14 | Duration: 3m 51s
  Full report: <localhost:3000 report URL>
```

**What's different from Prevoyant's direct inbound:** Prevoyant alone would need exact `/dev PROJ-1234` — no "Hey, can you…" parsing. Hermes adds the NL layer; the heavy lifting on Prevoyant's side is identical.

---

#### Example 2 — Review request in a team group chat

```
─── #payments-team Telegram group ───

@lead-dev (Telegram, 09:14):
  @prevoyant_via_hermes_bot please review TRX-2001 before standup

Hermes (09:14):
  Got it @lead-dev — review queued for TRX-2001. Will reply here at standup
  time.

  [POST /internal/enqueue { ticket_key: "TRX-2001", mode: "review",
                            event_type: "jira.pr.opened",
                            meta: { requested_by: "@lead-dev",
                                    deadline: "standup" } }]

  ── Hermes polls /internal/jobs/recent-results every 60s ──

Hermes (09:21):
  TRX-2001 review complete:
  ✅ Approved — no blocking issues.
  • Coverage delta: +2.3% (87.1% → 89.4%)
  • New tests: 4 unit + 1 integration
  • Style: minor — one unused import in helpers.ts:8
  • Risk: low — touches isolated handler, no schema changes
  Recommendation: merge before standup. Full report attached.
```

**Why Hermes shines in groups:** the bot only responds when @mentioned (controlled by BotFather privacy mode, on by default). Multiple devs can chat freely without each line being interpreted as a command. Prevoyant's deterministic listener would react to anything starting with `/` from the allowlist chat — fine for a DM, noisy in a group.

---

#### Example 3 — Status check on an in-flight job

```
You (Telegram, 10:30):
  what's happening with PROJ-1234?

Hermes (10:30):
  Looking… checking Prevoyant's job state.
  [GET http://localhost:3000/internal/jobs/recent-results
       — returns nothing for in-flight, only completed]
  [GET http://localhost:3000/dashboard/json
       — public dashboard JSON includes the running ticket]

Hermes (10:30):
  PROJ-1234 is currently RUNNING in dev mode.

```

**Caveat — today's reality:** Prevoyant doesn't yet expose a dedicated `/internal/status/<ticket>` endpoint to Hermes, but the dashboard's public JSON at `/dashboard/json` carries the same information. A well-configured Hermes deployment can read it directly. The next reasonable improvement is a tightly-scoped `/internal/status` endpoint behind `X-Hermes-Secret` — open as a follow-up.

#### Example 4 — Conditional routing based on Jira metadata

This is what Hermes was built for: stitch together signals and make routing decisions Prevoyant alone couldn't.

```
[A Jira webhook lands at Hermes, not at Prevoyant.]
[Hermes sees: TRX-9988, label="urgent", assignee=@bob, status=Code Review]

Hermes (decides — its own rules):
  - urgent label + Code Review status → mode=review with priority=urgent
  - Notify @bob and the #payments-team group simultaneously
  - Track ticket for standup follow-up

Hermes → Prevoyant:
  POST /internal/enqueue
  { ticket_key: "TRX-9988", event_type: "jira.pr.opened",
    mode: "review", priority: "urgent",
    meta: { assignee: "@bob", label: "urgent" } }

Hermes → @bob (DM, instant):
  TRX-9988 review just queued urgent (you're assignee). ETA ~5 min.

Hermes → #payments-team (instant):
  Heads-up: TRX-9988 is in urgent review, @bob is on it. I'll post the result
  here when ready.

  ── 5 min later ──

Hermes → both chats:
  TRX-9988: ⚠️ REQUEST_CHANGES — found 2 blocking issues. See attached report.
```

This is the difference Hermes makes: **Prevoyant runs the analysis, Hermes orchestrates the human side of it** — fan-out, priority routing, conversational state, follow-ups.

#### How to mentally model it

| Layer       | Best at                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prevoyant direct inbound** (`PRX_TELEGRAM_INBOUND_ENABLED=Y`) | Deterministic slash commands. Single-user DMs. Zero LLM cost on the command path. No public URL needed. |
| **Hermes-routed inbound** (`PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y`)              | Natural-language requests. Group chats. Cross-platform fan-out (Telegram + Slack + Discord + email). Conditional routing rules. Conversational follow-ups. |

You can also run both **with separate bots** — one Telegram bot for `PRX_TELEGRAM_*` (Prevoyant's deterministic surface, e.g. for CI scripts that POST exact commands), and a different bot Hermes owns for the human-facing channel. They never collide because they have different tokens, so `getUpdates` on each is independent.

---

### Hermes can contribute to the KB (`POST /internal/kb/insights`)

Hermes is uniquely positioned to spot cross-ticket patterns ("5 tickets this fortnight share the same Redis auth failure"). This endpoint lets Hermes propose those observations back to Prevoyant's knowledge base — with a validation gate so bad contributions don't pollute the KB.

#### What the endpoint does

`POST /internal/kb/insights` (registered only when `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y`) accepts a JSON insight from Hermes:

```json
{
  "title":      "Recurring Redis auth failure pattern",
  "body":       "Markdown body, ≤ 16 KB. Describe the pattern, root cause, recommended action.",
  "tickets":    ["PROJ-1234", "PROJ-1456", "PROJ-2003"],
  "category":   "bug-pattern",
  "tags":       ["redis", "auth"],
  "confidence": "high",

  "self_assessment": {
    "score":    9,
    "criteria": { "specificity": 2, "evidence": 2, "actionability": 2, "originality": 2, "clarity": 1 },
    "reason":   "Cites 5 tickets sharing same WRONGPASS error; links specific commit; recommends pinning previous tag. Clarity docked 1 for compressed action section."
  }
}
```

Authentication: `X-Hermes-Secret: <PRX_HERMES_SECRET>` header. Schema validation enforced server-side (title ≤ 200 chars, body ≤ 16 KB, ≤ 50 tickets, ≤ 20 tags, `self_assessment.score` ∈ 0–10).

#### Three operating modes — `PRX_HERMES_KB_WRITEBACK_ENABLED`

| Mode | What happens to an insight | When to pick this |
|---|---|---|
| **`N`** | Endpoint returns `403 {error: "disabled"}`. | You don't want Hermes touching the KB. |
| **`AUTO`** *(default)* | Hermes is the judge per the deployed SKILL.md (self-score ≥ 7 → POST; otherwise don't). Prevoyant runs a heuristic alongside as a sanity check. Both confident → auto-approved + indexed. Both reject → auto-rejected. They disagree → kicked to `pending/` for human review. | Default. Trust Hermes's self-judgement, verified by a cheap structural sanity check. |
| **`Y`** | Insight goes straight to `pending/` regardless of self-score. Every promotion requires a human click on the review page. | You don't trust Hermes's self-judgement yet, or you're auditing what it sends in week 1. |

The endpoint is **only registered when `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y`** — without Hermes enabled, the route doesn't exist at all.

#### How the AUTO-mode verdict works

**Hermes is the judge.** It's already an LLM with cross-ticket context; spawning a second LLM call from Prevoyant to second-guess it would be redundant. Instead, the deployed `SKILL.md` (auto-installed to `~/.hermes/skills/prevoyant/SKILL.md` on every server start) encodes the validation rubric and the contract: Hermes must self-score each insight 0–10 across five criteria and only POST when its self-score is ≥ 7.

**The five self-scoring criteria** (each 0–2):

1. **Specificity** — Does it name a concrete pattern with technical detail? Generic platitudes score 0.
2. **Evidence** — Does it reference real tickets or observable signals? Pure speculation scores 0.
3. **Actionability** — Could a developer act on this tomorrow? Vague philosophy scores 0.
4. **Originality** — Does it say something a careful reader of the linked tickets wouldn't already know? Restating ticket descriptions scores 0.
5. **Clarity** — Is the writing clear, organized, and free of hallucinated specifics? Confused or rambling text scores 0.

**Prevoyant's heuristic sanity check** (lives in `server/integrations/hermes/insightsValidator.js`) — pure rule-based scoring on five **structural** signals so a buggy / hallucinating Hermes can't silently poison the KB:

- **Body length** — between 300 and 8 000 chars scores 2; 150–12 000 scores 1; outside that scores 0.
- **Title quality** — ≥ 15 chars and not generic scores 2; short or generic scores 0–1.
- **Ticket references** — ≥ 3 tickets scores 2; 1–2 scores 1; none scores 0.
- **Structure** — multi-line body with headers or bullet lists scores 2; flat prose scores 0.
- **Specificity signals** — code spans, file paths, version numbers, or ticket-key mentions score 2; none scores 0.

**The verdict matrix** (combining Hermes's self-score and Prevoyant's heuristic):

| Hermes self | Heuristic | Verdict | Why |
|:---:|:---:|---|---|
| ≥ 7 | ≥ 4 | **approve** | Both confident — auto-approve and index |
| ≥ 7 | ≤ 3 | **pending** | Hermes confident but structure looks weak; human breaks tie |
| 4–6 | any | **pending** | Hermes itself flagged uncertainty; queue for human |
| ≤ 3 | any | **reject** | Hermes shouldn't have posted at all |
| missing | ≥ 8 | **approve** | Hermes skipped the contract; heuristic alone is strong |
| missing | ≤ 1 | **reject** | Heuristic alone is damning |
| missing | else | **pending** | No self-score, ambiguous structure — human reviews |

This is conservative by design — when in doubt, escalate to a human, never silently drop. No external API call, no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` required.

#### Where decisions are recorded

Every state transition is durable and auditable:

- **Files** — frontmatter on the saved markdown records `state`, `reviewed_at`, `reviewer` (`hermes-self+heuristic`, `hermes-self`, `heuristic-only`, or `dashboard` for human reviews), `auto_approved` / `auto_rejected`, `self_score`, `heuristic_score`, `self_reason`.
- **Activity log** — `hermes_kb_insight` (initial POST), `hermes_kb_insight_auto_approved`, `hermes_kb_insight_auto_rejected`, `hermes_kb_insight_approved` (human), `hermes_kb_insight_rejected` (human). Visible on `/dashboard/activity`.
- **POST response** — Hermes immediately knows the verdict from `status` (`approved` / `rejected` / `pending_review`), with both `self_score` and `heuristic_score` echoed back so it can self-correct (e.g. don't re-POST the same observation if rejected).

Rejected files are kept for **30 days** in `<KB>/hermes-insights/rejected/` for audit, then auto-pruned. Approved files live permanently in `<KB>/hermes-insights/approved/`.

#### Reviewing pending insights

Click the **✎ Review N** badge in the dashboard topbar (only visible when `N` > 0), or navigate to `/dashboard/hermes-insights` directly. Each pending insight shows:

- Title, category, confidence, recorded date
- Tickets referenced + tags (as code chips)
- Full body
- Buttons: **✓ Approve as-is** · **✎ Edit & approve** (inline editor for title / body / category) · **✗ Reject** (with optional ≤ 500-char reason)

Approving triggers an immediate memory-index refresh so the insight starts influencing future Claude Code runs within seconds. Rejecting just moves the file; nothing else changes.

#### Quick smoke test

```bash
# 1. Enable Hermes mode + writeback, restart server.
echo 'PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y'                  >> .env
echo 'PRX_HERMES_KB_WRITEBACK_ENABLED=AUTO'  >> .env
echo 'PRX_HERMES_SECRET=test-secret'         >> .env

# 2. POST a weak insight WITHOUT self_assessment — heuristic catches it.
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/kb/insights \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Hermes-Secret: test-secret" \
  -d '{"title":"insight","body":"things happened","category":"insight"}'
# → {"status":"rejected","mode":"AUTO","validator":"heuristic-only","self_score":null,"heuristic_score":0, …}

# 3. POST a strong insight WITH self_assessment — both layers agree, auto-approved.
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/kb/insights \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Hermes-Secret: test-secret" \

### Platform support

| Feature                                          | macOS | Linux | Windows |
| ------------------------------------------------ | :---: | :---: | :-----: |
| **Prevoyant server** (Node.js + dashboard)       |   ✅   |   ✅   |    ✅    |
| **Telegram outbound + inbound** (built-in)       |   ✅   |   ✅   |    ✅    |
| **Hermes gateway — start / stop / log tail**     |   ✅   |   ✅   |    ✅ once Hermes itself is installed |
| **Hermes gateway — detect installed / running**  |   ✅   |   ✅   |    ✅ (uses `where` instead of `which`, looks in Windows install dirs, reads `~\.hermes\gateway.pid`) |
| **Hermes — automatic install**                   |   ✅   |   ✅   |    ❌ — upstream installer is bash. Windows users must install Hermes manually (see below) |

The dashboard now detects the running platform and shows the right install guidance automatically. On Windows you'll see a blue "manual install required" banner instead of the macOS/Linux auto-install banner.

**Windows manual install (three options):**

1. **WSL2 (recommended).** Open Ubuntu/Debian inside WSL and run the standard installer:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
   ```

   Then either run Prevoyant from inside the same WSL distro, or symlink/copy the resulting `hermes` binary into a Windows-visible path.

2. **Git Bash.** Run the same curl command from Git Bash. Requires Python 3.11+ on Windows PATH and `pip` available — Hermes's installer expects these.

3. **Native build.** Clone `NousResearch/hermes-agent`, follow its Windows-specific instructions, and produce `hermes.exe`.

After installing, drop the binary into any of these locations (or anywhere on `PATH`):

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\hermes\bin\hermes.exe`
- `%USERPROFILE%\.hermes\bin\hermes.exe`
- `%ProgramFiles%\hermes\bin\hermes.exe`

Then click **Recheck** in the Hermes Config page — Prevoyant will pick it up immediately. From that point on the start/stop, log tail, and gateway-status dashboard work identically to macOS/Linux.

> **What you give up on Windows:** the one-click auto-install. Everything else — runtime gateway management, Telegram inbound/outbound, activity log, the `/internal/enqueue` event handoff — works the same.

### Reverting to standalone

```bash
bash server/integrations/hermes/scripts/uninstall.sh
# Sets PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=N and clears gateway config.
# Restart the server to re-register /jira-events.
```

---

## Upgrading

```bash
# If registered with a local path:
git -C ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/dodogeny pull
claude plugin update prevoyant@dodogeny

# If registered with the hosted Git URL:
claude plugin update prevoyant@dodogeny

# Verify:
claude plugin list
```

> **Your data is safe across upgrades.** Upgrades only modify plugin files inside `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/dodogeny/`. Everything in `~/.prevoyant/` — your Knowledge Base, reports, session history, server state, and all runtime data — is never touched by `git pull` or `claude plugin update`. Your `.env` is gitignored and also never modified. If you re-run `scripts/setup.sh` after upgrading, it backs up your `.env` to `.env.bak` before skipping it.

> **Recommended before a major version upgrade:** create a backup from the dashboard (Settings → Backup & Export → Download Backup) or run the [tar backup command](#0-back-up-your-knowledge-base-recommended) from the Uninstalling section.

> **Pull fails with "untracked file: .claude/settings.local.json"?**
> This file is per-machine and is no longer tracked in the repo (gitignored since v1.2.2). Remove it, pull, then let the setup script recreate it:
> ```bash
> INSTALL=~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/dodogeny
> rm "$INSTALL/.claude/settings.local.json"
> git -C "$INSTALL" pull
> bash "$INSTALL/scripts/setup.sh"   # recreates settings.local.json
> ```

---

## Uninstalling

### 0. Back up your Knowledge Base (recommended)

The KB accumulates root causes, patterns, regression risks, and lessons learned across every ticket. Back it up before uninstalling if you may want to restore it later.

**Local mode** (default — KB at `~/.prevoyant/knowledge-base/` or `$PRX_KNOWLEDGE_DIR`):

```bash
# macOS / Linux — creates a timestamped archive in your home directory
KB_DIR="${PRX_KNOWLEDGE_DIR:-$HOME/.prevoyant/knowledge-base}"
tar -czf "$HOME/prevoyant-kb-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz" -C "$(dirname "$KB_DIR")" "$(basename "$KB_DIR")"
echo "Backup saved to: $HOME/prevoyant-kb-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz"
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
$KBDir = if ($env:PRX_KNOWLEDGE_DIR) { $env:PRX_KNOWLEDGE_DIR } else { "$env:USERPROFILE\.prevoyant\knowledge-base" }
$Archive = "$env:USERPROFILE\prevoyant-kb-backup-$(Get-Date -Format yyyyMMdd).zip"
Compress-Archive -Path $KBDir -DestinationPath $Archive
Write-Host "Backup saved to: $Archive"
```

**Distributed mode** (KB is already in your private git repo — just confirm the remote is up to date):

```bash
git -C "${PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE:-$HOME/.prevoyant/kb}" push
echo "KB is safely stored in your remote repo."
```

**To restore later**, reinstall the plugin (Quick Start steps 1–3), then:

```bash
# Local mode — extract into the KB directory
tar -xzf ~/prevoyant-kb-backup-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz -C ~/.prevoyant/

# Distributed mode — set PRX_KB_REPO in .env; the skill clones it automatically on first run
```

---

### 1. Disable and remove the plugin

```bash
claude plugin disable prevoyant@dodogeny
claude plugin uninstall prevoyant@dodogeny
```

### 2. Remove the marketplace registration

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3 - <<'EOF'
import json, os
path = os.path.expanduser("~/.claude/settings.json")
if not os.path.exists(path):
    print("settings.json not found — nothing to do")
else:
    with open(path) as f:
        s = json.load(f)
    s.get("extraKnownMarketplaces", {}).pop("dodogeny", None)
    with open(path, "w") as f:
        json.dump(s, f, indent=2)
        f.write("\n")
    print("dodogeny removed from settings.json")
EOF
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$path = "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\settings.json"
if (Test-Path $path) {
    $s = Get-Content $path -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
    if ($s.extraKnownMarketplaces.PSObject.Properties['dodogeny']) {
        $s.extraKnownMarketplaces.PSObject.Properties.Remove('dodogeny')
        $s | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Set-Content $path -Encoding UTF8
        Write-Host "dodogeny removed from settings.json"
    }
} else { Write-Host "settings.json not found — nothing to do" }
```

### 3. Remove the cloned repository (if installed locally)

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/dodogeny
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\dodogeny"
```

### 4. Remove local data (optional)

The plugin never writes data outside its own directory and the KB location you configured. If you want a full clean:

```bash
# Knowledge base (local mode default)
rm -rf ~/.prevoyant

# PDF / HTML reports
rm -rf ~/.prevoyant/reports   # or the path set in CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR
```

> `.env` and `.claude/settings.local.json` inside the repo directory are also removed when you delete the repository in step 3.

## Changelog

### v1.3.6 — Field Assistant + P2P Mesh Validation

- **Field Assistant (`/dashboard/field`):** new dashboard tab giving field engineers a direct, bidirectional interface to team knowledge. Four tabs: **Ask the Team** (chat-style KB query backed by Cortex facts, shared KB files, and P2P mesh observations), **Record Field Finding** (structured form for logging site discoveries to `shared/field-intel.md`), **Session History** (saved Q&A sessions, local only), and **Field Intel KB** (live read of the field intel log).

- **AI-assisted field finding entry:** entering a Jira ticket key and tabbing away triggers an auto-synthesis pass. Claude reads the Jira description and all comments, then pre-fills symptom, root cause, fix, component, and tags — highlighted in amber to distinguish AI-populated fields from manual entries. Root cause field is intentionally left for manual review.

- **P2P mesh validation:** when a field finding is saved, the observation is broadcast to all connected mesh peers via the Collective Intelligence Mesh (`PRX_CORTEX_P2P_ENABLED=Y`). Each peer independently validates the finding against its local Cortex (Claude evaluates technical credibility and KB value). Valid findings are re-broadcast with an incremented `confirmCount`; invalid ones are re-broadcast with a `meshRejected` flag. When the originating machine's observation reaches `PRX_CORTEX_AUTO_PROMOTE_THRESHOLD` confirms, the KB entry is promoted from `[FIELD VERIFIED pending]` to `[MESH VALIDATED — N nodes confirmed]`. Peer machines write their own idempotent KB entries once threshold is reached.

- **Full finding payload survives mesh transit:** the complete payload (symptom, root cause, fix, Jira metadata, `obsKey`) is stored in the observation's `raw` field so it survives `mergeObservation`'s standard-field-only merge and is available to every peer validator.

- **`field-intel` added to high-signal mesh types:** `field-intel` observations now propagate to peers via the quality gate in `isMeshQualityObservation()`. Previously the type was missing from `HIGH_SIGNAL_TYPES` and observations were silently dropped.

- **Browser notifications for mesh validation results:** the Field Assistant polls `GET /dashboard/field/notifications` every 5 seconds. When a validation result arrives (accepted or flagged), a dismissible banner card appears above the tabs with status, reason, finding reference, and node count. If the user has granted OS notification permission, a native browser notification also pops — visible even when the tab is in the background. Fixed a `SyntaxError: Unexpected string` that prevented the entire Field Assistant script block from parsing (caused by `\'` inside a backtick template literal being reduced to `'` by Node.js, breaking the single-quoted string in the generated client JS). Fixed by replacing `document.getElementById(\'id\').remove()` with `this.parentElement.remove()` in the dismiss button.

- **Email notifications for mesh validation results:** in addition to browser notifications, `PRX_EMAIL_TO` receives an email when validation completes — ACCEPTED with node count and reason, or FLAGGED with the peer's rejection reason. Uses the new reusable `server/notifications/email.js` SMTP module (extracted from `ticketWatcherWorker.js`).

- **Generic field engineer persona (no personal names in server):** all references to a specific engineer name removed from the server codebase. The Field Assistant hero now reads "Field Engineer · Record Field Finding"; chat bubbles display "You"; activity log actor is `field-engineer`; Cortex observations use `persona: 'field-engineer'`. Persona file renamed to `plugin/config/personas/field-engineer.md`.

- **Knowledge Builder — `PRX_JIRA_PROJECT` scope enforced on all Jira calls:** previously only the Step J2 initial query included `project = IV AND ...`; Claude's subsequent Jira MCP calls (follow-up lookups, linked issues, subtasks) had no project filter and pulled tickets from other projects. Fixed by adding a `HARD CONSTRAINT` in the prompt preamble and a per-step reminder at Step J2 — both conditional on `PRX_JIRA_PROJECT` being set — that require every Jira MCP call in the session to include the project scope.

- **New files:** `server/runner/fieldIntelAgent.js` (context builder, KB writer, AI synthesiser, mesh validator, session store), `server/notifications/email.js` (reusable SMTP module), `server/notifications/browserQueue.js` (in-memory notification queue for browser polling), `docs/FIELD_ASSISTANT.md`, `plugin/config/personas/field-engineer.md`.

- **P2P is now the primary KB sync mechanism — Redis/Upstash removed:** `server/kb/kbSync.js`, `server/workers/kbSyncWorker.js`, and `server/memory/redisMemory.js` removed. `memoryAdapter.js` simplified to JSON-only. `PRX_REALTIME_KB_SYNC`, `PRX_UPSTASH_REDIS_URL`, `PRX_UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN`, `PRX_KB_SYNC_POLL_SECS`, `PRX_REDIS_ENABLED`, `PRX_REDIS_URL`, `PRX_REDIS_PASSWORD`, `PRX_REDIS_PREFIX`, and `PRX_REDIS_TTL_DAYS` removed from `.env`. `PRX_P2P_ENABLED` defaults to `Y`. Agent memory index remains JSON-backed (`~/.prevoyant/memory/index.json`). Discovery falls back to mDNS + public IPFS bootstrap nodes.

- **Four advanced workers removed:** Decision-Outcome Linker (`decisionOutcomeWorker.js`), Stale Branch Detector (`staleBranchWorker.js`), Memory Pattern Miner (`memoryPatternMinerWorker.js`), and KB Staleness Scanner (`kbStalenessWorker.js`) removed. KB Review Mode now processes Step 13j (KB Flow Analyst) only. Steps 13k and 13l removed from the dev skill workflow.

- **P2P reconcile routing fix:** the `reconcile-needed` main-thread roundtrip was a dead loop — `msg.peerId` was always `undefined` and the worker used `peers[0]` regardless. Fixed by passing the sync callback directly into `applyReconcile()` so delta sync and cortex dump are triggered inline with the correct `libp2pNode` scope. Dead `trigger-reconcile-sync` / `trigger-cortex-dump` message handlers removed.

- **Cortex broadcast peer-connection guard:** `cortex-observation-written` now checks `p2pBridge.getState().peers.length > 0` before posting a `cortex-broadcast` message — no-ops silently when no peers are connected rather than queueing into a disconnected worker.

### v1.3.5 — Collective Intelligence Mesh

- **Collective Intelligence Mesh (`PRX_CORTEX_P2P_ENABLED`):** extends the P2P KB Sync layer into a shared agent-observation network. When `PRX_CORTEX_P2P_ENABLED=Y`, every node's Cortex agent observations (findings, patterns, decisions recorded during sessions) are broadcast via a new `prevoyant/cortex-sync/1` GossipSub topic and merged into each connected node's local `CortexMemory`. Observations confirmed by 2+ independent nodes receive a higher `confirmCount` and can auto-promote to the KB when `PRX_CORTEX_P2P_CONSENSUS_PROMOTE_PCT` threshold is met. Requires `PRX_P2P_ENABLED=Y` and `PRX_CORTEX_ENABLED=Y`.

- **Organic network growth:** as new nodes join the P2P mesh, they immediately request a dump of the current observation cache via the `/prevoyant/cortex-query/1` stream protocol (dialed 3.5 s after first peer connect). New nodes start with the accumulated collective intelligence of the entire network without any manual sync step.

- **Agent access to network intelligence (Layer 0c):** when `PRX_CORTEX_P2P_ENABLED=Y`, the dev skill's Step 0 now includes a new **Layer 0c — Collective Intelligence Network Query** pass. At session start, agents call `GET /dashboard/cortex/network/query?minConfirms=2&limit=20` to retrieve cross-node confirmed observations and inject them into the Prior Knowledge block under a `NETWORK INTELLIGENCE` heading. Observations confirmed by 3+ nodes and promoted carry the same authority as local cortex facts.

- **HMAC-authenticated cortex messages:** all `cortex-observe`, `cortex-confirm`, and `cortex-retract` GossipSub messages are signed with `PRX_P2P_SECRET` using the existing HMAC-SHA256 envelope from the KB sync layer. Unsigned or tampered messages are silently dropped.

- **In-worker observation cache:** `kbP2pWorker.js` maintains a `Map<key, obs>` capped at 2000 entries. Peer observation requests are served entirely from this cache without touching LMDB (which remains main-thread only). Main thread merges received observations via `CortexMemory.mergeObservation()` — preserving local promotion state and taking `max(confirmCount)` across sources.

- **Infinite-loop guard:** `cortex-observation-written` events broadcast to peers only when `fromNetwork !== true`, preventing re-broadcast of observations already received from the network.

- **Animated Mesh badge in dashboard header:** when both `PRX_CORTEX_P2P_ENABLED=Y` and `PRX_P2P_ENABLED=Y`, an animated violet **Mesh** badge appears in the dashboard header beside the P2P badge. The badge features a 4-node diamond SVG with staggered per-edge glow animations and links to the Collective Intelligence Mesh settings section.

- **Settings UI — Collective Intelligence Mesh section:** new section in Settings with three controls: `PRX_CORTEX_P2P_ENABLED` (enable/disable mesh), `PRX_CORTEX_QUERY_ENABLED` (expose the `/cortex/network/query` API to agents), and `PRX_CORTEX_P2P_CONSENSUS_PROMOTE_PCT` (minimum % of network confirmation required for auto-promotion). Includes a live stats panel showing connected peers, observations in/out, and last mesh sync timestamp.

- **New API endpoints:** `GET /dashboard/cortex/network/peers` (mesh health + stats from bridge state) and `GET /dashboard/cortex/network/query` (merged observation list, filterable by `type`, `tag`, `minConfirms`, `limit`).

- **Cortex ping:** each node broadcasts a `cortex-ping` message every reconcile interval (default 60 min) and once 20 s after startup, advertising its `observationCount`. Peers use this to decide whether to request a full dump.

### v1.3.4 — P2P KB Sync — Trickle Mode, Visual Indicators & Reliability Fixes

- **Encrypted-file transfer fix (critical bugfix):** When `PRX_P2P_ENCRYPT=Y`, the worker sets `content: null` on every file before encrypting. The old `filter(f => f.content !== null)` guard silently discarded all of them, resulting in zero files sent over the network. Fixed to `filter(f => typeof f.content === 'string' || f.encrypted)` so encrypted payloads are included. Batch size calculation also hardened with a new `filePayloadSize()` helper that handles both plaintext and AES-256-GCM payloads without throwing a TypeError.

- **Trickle Update mode (`PRX_P2P_TRICKLE`):** New Y/N setting for incremental, network-adaptive GossipSub delivery. When enabled, KB files are sent in small batches starting at 2 files; batch size and inter-batch delay self-adjust based on measured network RTT — fast links converge to 10 files/batch with 100 ms gaps, slow or congested links back off to 1 file/batch with up to 10 s gaps. Default: `N` (bulk — all files in one or two large messages). Configurable from Settings → P2P KB Sync. Delay and batch thresholds are self-determined by the worker; only the on/off toggle is user-facing.

- **Animated mesh network topology icons:** The P2P Network panel now uses SMIL SVG mesh icons instead of socket plug icons. Three live states — **Connected** (cyan: 3-node triangle with all edges lit, staggered per-node glow rings, and a white data-packet traversing the edges), **Searching** (amber: single node with two expanding sonar rings and 4 ghost peer nodes fading at the corners), **Starting/off** (grey: single dimmed node with a slow pulse ring). Icons update in real time as peer count changes.

- **Animated P2P header badge:** When `PRX_P2P_ENABLED=Y`, a cyan flashing badge labelled "P2P" appears in the dashboard header beside the Cortex badge. The badge pulses with a slow glow animation (2.4 s cycle) and links directly to the P2P Network section on the main dashboard. In autonomous-mode the badge renders white/muted to match the orange header style.

- **Redis/Upstash fields disabled when P2P is active:** In Settings → Real-time KB Sync, the `PRX_REALTIME_KB_SYNC`, `PRX_UPSTASH_REDIS_URL`, `PRX_UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN`, and `PRX_KB_SYNC_POLL_SECS` fields are greyed out and non-interactive when `PRX_P2P_ENABLED=Y`, with a cyan info banner explaining that P2P takes precedence over Redis/Upstash for KB sync. Fields shared with the P2P worker (`PRX_KB_SYNC_MACHINE`, `PRX_KB_SYNC_TRIGGER`, `PRX_KB_SYNC_DEBOUNCE_SECS`) remain editable.

- **RSA key field fixes:** Two bugs prevented RSA key pairs from persisting after clicking Save. (1) The "Generate RSA Key Pair" and "Delete Keys" JavaScript functions targeted `inp-PRX_P2P_RSA_*` element IDs, but `fld()` generates `f_PRX_P2P_RSA_*` — the fields were never populated. (2) `<input type="password/text">` strips newlines — PEM content was truncated to the first line on every save. Both fields are now rendered as `<textarea>` and all element ID references corrected.

- **PEM key serialisation hardened:** A new `envSerialize()` helper wraps any multi-line value in a double-quoted, `\n`-escaped single line before writing to `.env`. `readEnvValues()` expands `\n` escape sequences back to real newlines on read. Raw multi-line PEM blocks previously written to `.env` are skipped and replaced on the next save, eliminating the bug where only the first line of a key was loaded across restarts.

- **Retry with exponential backoff:** `requestDeltaSync` retries failed stream dials up to 3 times (2 s → 4 s delay). GossipSub `publish` calls also retry up to 3 times with 1 s → 2 s delays before logging a warning. Network transients no longer cause lost KB updates.

- **AES-256-GCM file-content encryption (`PRX_P2P_ENCRYPT=Y`):** when enabled, every KB file's content is encrypted with AES-256-GCM (random IV per file) before leaving the machine. The encryption key is derived from `PRX_P2P_SECRET`. Peers without the same secret receive unreadable ciphertext. Applies to both GossipSub broadcast and stream-based sync. Default: N (plaintext — suitable for private networks).

- **RSA-2048 node identity keys (`PRX_P2P_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY` / `PRX_P2P_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY`):** each node can hold a persistent RSA-2048 key pair for future per-peer key exchange. A **Generate RSA Key Pair** button in Settings → P2P KB Sync creates both keys in-browser using the Web Crypto API and pre-fills the fields — no tooling required.

- **Non-blocking async file I/O:** `gatherAllFiles` and `gatherChangedFiles` now use `fs.promises` (async) instead of `fs.readFileSync`. The libp2p event loop stays responsive during large KB scans; peer connections and GossipSub messages are processed concurrently with file transfers.

- **Settings page additions:** `PRX_P2P_SECRET`, `PRX_P2P_RECONCILE_MINS`, `PRX_P2P_ENCRYPT`, `PRX_P2P_TRICKLE`, `PRX_P2P_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `PRX_P2P_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY` are all configurable from Settings → P2P KB Sync without editing `.env` manually.

- **`PRX_P2P_SECRET` default:** `.env` ships with `PRX_P2P_SECRET=LetMeInPrevoyant@2026`. Change this to your own strong secret before sharing the setup with teammates.

### v1.3.3 — P2P KB Sync (libp2p)

- **P2P knowledge-base propagation via libp2p:** new optional transport layer that replaces Redis/Upstash as the KB notification bus. When `PRX_P2P_ENABLED=Y`, the server starts a libp2p node (TCP · Noise encryption · Yamux muxer · GossipSub) that discovers peers via hardcoded IPFS public bootstrap nodes and optional mDNS for LAN auto-discovery. Two propagation modes: in `distributed` KB mode P2P signals peers to `git pull` (git still carries file content); in `local` KB mode changed `.md` files are bundled inline in the GossipSub message and written directly on receipt — **no git required**. Peer key is generated once and persisted to `~/.prevoyant/server/p2p-key.b64` for a stable peer ID across restarts.

- **P2P dashboard panel — live wire:** a live animated network visualisation appears on the main dashboard when P2P is active. Shows the self node at centre, connected peers as nodes around it, and pulsing animated wire lines between them. Activity (sync in/out) triggers a glow burst on the wire. Peer count, self peer ID, sync counters, and last-sync timestamp are displayed. Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds.

- **Settings UI integration:** new **P2P KB Sync** section in Settings with four controls (`PRX_P2P_ENABLED`, `PRX_P2P_PORT`, `PRX_P2P_MDNS_ENABLED`, `PRX_P2P_BOOTSTRAP_NODES`) and an embedded live peers panel with ↻ Refresh button. Variables are hot-toggled via the `settings-saved` event without a server restart.

- **`GET /dashboard/p2p/peers` JSON endpoint:** returns `{ enabled, selfId, addrs, peers[], topic, syncsIn, syncsOut, lastSync }` — usable as a machine-readable health check for P2P network status.

- **Precedence rule:** when P2P is active, `startKbSync()` (Redis/Upstash) is skipped automatically. No Upstash account is needed in P2P mode.

- **Repowise init fallback (bugfix):** `cortexWorker.js` now detects the "No previous sync found" error from `repowise update` (which occurs when `.repowise/` exists but is empty/corrupt) and automatically retries with `repowise init` — self-healing without requiring manual intervention.

### v1.3.2 — Cortex Intelligence Layer + Fragility / Co-Change / Decision-Outcome (Muninn-inspired)

- **Cortex — always-on intelligence layer (optional):** new background worker at `server/workers/cortexWorker.js` that sits on top of the KB. When `PRX_CORTEX_ENABLED=Y`, it watches the KB filesystem (debounced via `PRX_CORTEX_DEBOUNCE_SECS`) and synthesises a curated set of fact files at `~/.prevoyant/cortex/facts/*.md` — architecture, business rules, patterns, confirmed decisions, hotspots, glossary. Agents reference these in Step 0 of the dev skill instead of trawling the raw KB on every session. A new dashboard page at **`/dashboard/cortex`** renders every fact file with a "Re-synthesise now" button; the dashboard header gains an **animated revolving brain badge** while cortex is active. Cortex files are included in the backup/export ZIP via a new checkbox.

- **Repowise integration (optional sub-feature of Cortex):** runs [repowise](https://github.com/repowise-dev/repowise) on a configurable cadence (`PRX_REPOWISE_INTERVAL_DAYS`, default 1d) to refresh the source repo's dependency graph + auto-generated wiki, which the cortex synthesizer then ingests into `cortex/facts/hotspots.md` and `cortex/facts/architecture.md`. Cross-platform installer at `plugin/install/install-repowise.js` (pipx → uv → pip user fallback ladder) runs from the Cortex page button or, when `PRX_REPOWISE_AUTO_INSTALL=Y`, automatically on `SessionStart`. Graceful degradation: cortex still works on KB-only sources if repowise is missing.

- **Fragility score (Muninn-inspired) — Step 5 file map column:** new helper `server/runner/fragilityScore.js` produces a weighted 0.0–1.0 score per file from six signals — dependents, coverage gap, error history, change velocity, complexity, export surface. SKILL.md Step 5 (`dev` skill) now injects a `Fragility` column into the file map so the engineering panel gets a quantitative risk anchor (`HIGH/MED/LOW`) instead of relying on Riley's binary "no test file found" warning. Self-test on `server/index.js` returns `0.56 MED` — 21 commits in 90d, no test sibling. Helper is CLI-callable: `node server/runner/fragilityScore.js --repo $REPO_DIR --file <path> --json`. SKILL.md version bumped to v1.4.0; changelog entry SC-011 added.

- **Co-change correlation in the conflict checker — silent conflict detection:** the existing `server/runner/conflictChecker.js` now invokes a new `server/runner/coChangeIndex.js` module that mines `git log --name-only` from `PRX_REPO_DIR` (180-day window by default; tunable via `PRX_COCHANGE_WINDOW_DAYS`) into a cached file-pair frequency map at `~/.prevoyant/server/co-change-cache.json` (TTL via `PRX_COCHANGE_CACHE_TTL_DAYS`). Surfaces the **silent conflict** case — two tickets that don't touch the same file but touch files that historically co-change with each other. Logs to a new `silent_conflict_warning` activity event. The cache rebuilds when its HEAD pointer differs from the live `git rev-parse HEAD`.

- **Decision-Outcome Linker (optional worker):** new `server/workers/decisionOutcomeWorker.js` joins KB decision entries (`shared/decisions.md`, `shared/skill-changelog.md`, `lessons-learned/*.md`) against recent agent retros from `personas/memory/{agent}/*.md`, then grades each decision **CONFIRMED / CONTRADICTED / PENDING** based on a phrase-bank evidence pass. Proposals are written to `~/.prevoyant/knowledge-buildup/decision-outcomes.md` (PENDING APPROVAL — humans promote). Closes the loop the KB Flow Analyst left half-open: hypotheses get *graded* by outcomes instead of being captured and forgotten. Configurable interval (default 7d), lookback (default 90d), and min-evidence threshold (default 2).

- **Stale Branch Detector (worker):** scheduled scanner that lists feature/fix branches in `PRX_REPO_DIR`, cross-references each Jira ticket key against KB session records, and checks Jira's development panel for any linked PR. Branches whose ticket has a completed KB session but no PR (and no commit activity for `PRX_STALE_BRANCH_DAYS` days) are flagged in `~/.prevoyant/knowledge-buildup/stale-branches.md`. Gracefully degrades when Jira credentials are unavailable.

- **Settings UI parity:** every new env var (~16 of them across cortex, repowise, fragility, co-change, decision-outcome, stale-branch) is editable from the dashboard Settings page and persisted to `.env` via the existing FIELDS allowlist. Each new worker has a "▶ Run now" button. The hot-reload `settings-saved` handler in `server/index.js` starts/stops every new worker without a server restart.

- **Six new dashboard activity events** are styled: `merge_conflict_warning`, `silent_conflict_warning`, `stale_branches_scanned`, `decisions_reviewed`, `cortex_synthesized`, and the existing `kb_staleness_scanned` / `pattern_miner_proposed` are styled for the first time too. New "Cortex" entry in the dashboard nav menu (with "active" pill when enabled).

- **CortexMemory — LMDB-backed fast memory engine:** the cortex layer now includes a 3-tier memory engine (`server/runner/cortexMemory.js`) — LRU hot cache → LMDB mmap disk store (sub-millisecond reads, crash-proof MVCC) → JSONL fallback when LMDB is not yet installed. `lmdb` is auto-installed on `npm install` (postinstall hook) and on every `SessionStart` when `PRX_CORTEX_ENABLED=Y`; health and backend status are visible on the Cortex dashboard page. One-time migration moves existing JSONL store into LMDB automatically on first start.

- **Agent knowledge API — observe / context / promote:** agents now have a structured HTTP interface for reading and writing knowledge during sessions. `POST /cortex/memory/observe` accepts typed discoveries (`type: pattern | decision | business-rule | anomaly | hotspot | context`) with a human-readable `summary` and optional ticket reference; they are stored in LMDB and trigger a debounced re-synthesis within 30s. `GET /cortex/memory/context?ticket=PRX-NNN` returns all synthesised facts plus recent observations in a single call — agents use this in Step 0 instead of assembling from multiple endpoints. `POST /cortex/memory/promote` graduates an observation permanently into the KB (`shared/patterns.md`, `shared/decisions.md`, etc.) based on its type, appends a timestamped block, tags the entry as `promoted` in LMDB, and fires a fresh synthesis pass via `fs.watch`. A seventh synthesiser writes `cortex/facts/observations.md` from all `agent-observed` LMDB entries — in distributed mode this file is inside the KB git repo and syncs to team machines automatically, so a new developer's first pull already includes recent agent discoveries.

- **Autonomy system — confidence-gated self-improvement (`PRX_CORTEX_AUTONOMY_LEVEL`):** the AI team can now be configured to operate at four levels of autonomy, from fully human-gated (level 0) to full-trust self-promotion (level 3). At level 1, `confirmCount` is tracked across sessions so agents know how many independent sessions have validated an observation. At level 2 — the recommended production setting — observations that reach a configurable confirmation threshold (`PRX_CORTEX_AUTO_PROMOTE_THRESHOLD`, default 3) are queued with a 24-hour human review window; a human can reject via the Cortex dashboard or `POST /cortex/memory/reject-promotion` before the scheduler auto-promotes. At level 3, promotion is immediate on the N-th confirm. Two new fact files synthesised: `session-memory.md` (per-agent session summaries keyed by `persona`, letting agents recall what they worked on previously) and `autonomy-queue.md` (pending promotion queue visible to all agents). New `GET /cortex/memory/pending-promotions` and `POST /cortex/memory/reject-promotion` endpoints. Autonomy queue panel added to the Cortex dashboard with inline approve/reject buttons. **→ [docs/AUTONOMY.md](docs/AUTONOMY.md)**

### v1.3.1 — graphify Knowledge-Graph Augmentation

- **graphify is now a first-class prerequisite.** Setup scripts (`scripts/setup.sh` and `scripts/setup.ps1`) install [graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) via `uv tool install graphifyy` (falling back to `pipx install graphifyy` if `uv` is unavailable) and run an initial `graphify .` extraction against `PRX_REPO_DIR` at the end of setup — so session 1 starts with a ready `graph.json` + `GRAPH_REPORT.md`. Works identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows; install paths (`~/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` on Windows) are added to `PATH` for the current session and persisted on Windows via `setx`.

- **New Pass 0 in SKILL.md Step 5 — Locate Affected Code:** before grep/ast-grep, the dev agent queries `graph.json` for the target symbol's location and neighbors. Short-circuits Passes 1–2 when the graph already knows the answer (cost ≈ 0 tokens). Falls through gracefully when the graph is unavailable, stale, or ambiguous — Passes 1–3 (grep → ast-grep → Read) are unchanged. A stale-graph guard rebuilds `graph.json` in the background when the repo has moved >24h or >100 commits ahead of the last extraction.

- **Class hierarchy via `get-neighbors` (Step 5.5):** the four `sg --pattern 'class $NAME extends …'` queries are now backed by a single `graphify get-neighbors --edges extends,implements --depth 3` call when the graph is present. Transitive, language-agnostic, and faster on large hierarchies. ast-grep remains the documented fallback.

- **Graph-aware KB stale-anchor sweep (Step 0a):** the lightweight KB integrity sweep no longer relies on file-existence checks alone. With `graph.json` present, every `file:line` reference in `shared/*.md` and `core-mental-map/*.md` is validated against the live symbol graph — catching method renames, intra-file moves, and cross-file relocations that the previous `ls` heuristic missed entirely. Emits separate `STALE_REF` and `RELOCATED_REF` lists so Step 13c (shared) and Step 13g (CMM) can auto-heal with either `[DELETED]` or `[RELOCATED]` markers. Falls back to the file-existence check when graphify is unavailable.

- **KB coverage audit — automatic candidate staging:** at session start, the dev skill reads `GRAPH_REPORT.md` and stages two kinds of KB candidates into `~/.prevoyant/knowledge-buildup/kbflow-pending.md` for Sam's Step 13j review: (a) **god-node gaps** — graphify's most-connected symbols that have no current `INDEX.md` entry, flagging a coverage hole; (b) **surprising cross-module connections** — high-rank unexpectedness edges from `GRAPH_REPORT.md` that may deserve a `shared/architecture.md` or `shared/regression-risks.md` entry. Candidates land as `Status: PENDING APPROVAL` and are picked up by the standing agenda check — any coverage gap surfaced this way forces Step 13j review before the session closes.

- **Cross-platform parity:** graphify install handled across all three platforms with the same fallback ladder: `uv tool` → `pipx` → manual instructions. Setup script step count bumped from 9/9 → 10/10 to surface graphify as a distinct, optional-but-installed-by-default prerequisite. SKILL.md additions degrade gracefully when graphify is absent — every new path documents its grep/ast-grep fallback inline.

### v1.3.0 — Hermes Integration (Full-Time Agent Mode)

- **Hermes integration — optional feature flag:** Prevoyant can now operate as a full-time autonomous agent by connecting to a local [Hermes](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent) gateway. Toggle via `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y/N` in `.env` or **Settings → Hermes Integration** in the dashboard. Default is `N` — standalone behaviour is unchanged.

- **Trigger priority:** Cron polling (`WEBHOOK_POLL_INTERVAL_DAYS`) is now explicitly the primary/default trigger. The Jira webhook at `/jira-events` acts as a real-time accelerator on top of the cron heartbeat. When Hermes is enabled, Hermes owns both the cron schedule and webhook reception.

- **`POST /internal/enqueue`:** New internal endpoint registered only when `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y`. Hermes calls this to hand off Jira/GitHub events into the Prevoyant job queue. Validates via `X-Hermes-Secret` header. Maps Hermes event types (`jira.status.in_progress`, `jira.pr.opened`, `jira.ticket.stale`, etc.) to Prevoyant modes automatically.

- **Hermes result notifier:** When a job completes, fails, or is interrupted, Prevoyant POSTs the result to `<PRX_HERMES_GATEWAY_URL>/prevoyant/result` so Hermes can deliver it to Telegram, Slack, Discord, or any configured platform. The notifier starts automatically when Hermes is enabled (including reactive toggle from settings without restart).

- **`server/integrations/hermes/hermes-skill.md`:** agentskills.io-compatible SKILL.md file Hermes loads to understand how to invoke Prevoyant — event types, payload format, result callback shape, and KB read path.

- **`server/integrations/hermes/scripts/install.sh` / `uninstall.sh`:** Interactive setup/teardown scripts. `install.sh` writes the Hermes env vars, prints Jira webhook registration instructions, and guides the Hermes-side configuration in one run. `uninstall.sh` reverts to standalone in under 30 seconds.

- **Startup fallback sweep in Hermes mode:** Even when Hermes owns the cron, a one-time `poll-jira.sh` sweep runs on server startup to recover tickets that arrived while the server was offline.

- **Telegram notifications (built-in, no Hermes required):** New `PRX_TELEGRAM_*` channel in `server/notifications/telegram.js` dispatched from the activity-log fan-out alongside webhook + WhatsApp. Configure under **Dashboard → Hermes Config → Telegram Notifications**: bot token, chat ID, and per-event allowlist (`ticket_completed`, `ticket_failed`, etc.). Sends `🟢 Hermes gateway started`, `❌ PROJ-123 failed`, and the other activity events as plain-text Telegram messages. Independent of `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED` — works in either mode.

- **Bi-directional Telegram (slash commands):** Toggle `PRX_TELEGRAM_INBOUND_ENABLED=Y` to make Prevoyant accept commands sent to the bot. Available commands: `/dev <KEY>` queues a dev-mode analysis, `/review <KEY>` queues review mode, `/estimate <KEY>` queues estimate mode, `/status <KEY>` shows the live state of a ticket, `/queue` lists all active+queued tickets, `/help` shows the menu. The listener long-polls Telegram (`getUpdates`, ~25 s wait) and persists its update offset in `~/.prevoyant/telegram-state.json` across restarts. **Auto-disabled when `PRX_HERMES_ENABLED=Y`** — Hermes already owns the chat surface and only one consumer can poll a bot at a time. Only messages from `PRX_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are accepted; others are dropped with a debug log. Inbound listener status (running / stopped / off-due-to-Hermes) is shown live in the Hermes Config page.

- **Hermes gateway lifecycle dashboard:** New dedicated page at `/dashboard/hermes-config` (linked from the topbar's Hermes badge when enabled). Live status pills with coloured pulse dots (CLI installed · Gateway running · Skill deployed), Start/Stop gateway buttons, post-Start verification poll (12 s) that surfaces crashes via toast, and a rolling gateway log panel that tails `~/.hermes/gateway.log` and auto-refreshes every 5 s. Gateway liveness now reads `~/.hermes/gateway.pid` directly instead of relying on `pgrep` (the daemon runs as `python -m hermes_cli.main gateway run`, which the old `pgrep "hermes gateway"` heuristic missed). Stop uses `hermes gateway stop` with a SIGTERM fallback to the recorded PID.

- **Hermes can contribute to the KB — with human review (opt-in):** New endpoint `POST /internal/kb/insights` lets Hermes post cross-ticket observations back to Prevoyant's knowledge base. Gated by `PRX_HERMES_KB_WRITEBACK_ENABLED=Y` (default `N`, endpoint returns `403` until flipped). Validates payload schema: title ≤ 200 chars, markdown body ≤ 16 KB, ≤ 50 referenced tickets, ≤ 20 tags; categories `bug-pattern`, `lesson`, `playbook`, `warning`, `insight`. **Pending → Approved review pipeline:** insights land at `<KB>/hermes-insights/pending/<date>-<slug>.md` and are surfaced on a new dashboard page at `/dashboard/hermes-insights` with **Approve as-is / Edit & approve / Reject** buttons. Approved files move to `<KB>/hermes-insights/approved/` and are immediately re-indexed by the memory layer so future Claude Code dev/review/estimate runs see them as context. Rejected files (optional ≤ 500-char reason) move to `<KB>/hermes-insights/rejected/` for audit and auto-prune after 30 days. The main dashboard topbar gains a yellow "✎ Review N" badge when pending insights exist (polls every 30 s). Toggle from **Dashboard → Hermes Config → Behavior → KB Write-back**.

- **Cross-platform Hermes support:** Hermes lifecycle code now detects platform and uses `where` instead of `which` on Windows, looks for `hermes.exe / .cmd / .bat` in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\hermes\bin`, `%ProgramFiles%\hermes\bin`, and `%USERPROFILE%\.hermes\bin`, and spawns the gateway with `windowsHide: true` to suppress the console flash. Auto-install is bash-only and now bails cleanly on Windows with a blue install banner pointing to WSL2, Git Bash, or native-build paths. The pid-file-based liveness check, start/stop, log tail, and dashboard work identically across macOS, Linux, and Windows.

### v1.2.10 — Memory Efficiency, Animated Sun Logo, Backup & Export, Per-agent Personal Memory, KB Flow Analyst

- **Memory efficiency:** Replaced full `/dashboard/json` polling with a new `/dashboard/busy` endpoint (O(1) in-memory Map scan) used by the sun-logo indicator — eliminates disk I/O and array sorting on every 4-second poll. `loadSessions()` now caps in-memory history at 50 recent completed tickets (was unbounded — servers with thousands of session files loaded all into RAM). `getChartData()` result is cached for 60 seconds and invalidated on new events instead of recomputing on every page load. `seenThisSession` dedup Set is now capped at 1 000 entries with LRU eviction.

- **Animated sun logo:** A sun SVG replaces the static accent dot in the header of every dashboard page. The icon spins with an amber glow when any ticket is running, queued, or retrying — and returns to a quiet dimmed state when idle. Polls `/dashboard/busy` every 4 seconds; no-ops silently when the server is unreachable.

- **Backup & Export expanded:** Settings → Backup & Export now covers all runtime state, not just the knowledge base. New checkboxes for **Server state** (`activity-log.json` + `watched-tickets.json`), **Watch logs**, **Agent memory index**, and **Agent memory store — basic-memory MCP** (the persistent per-agent personal memory dir, only shown when it lives outside the KB), each with a live file count. Archive renamed `prevoyant-backup-<date>.tar.gz`. Import is unchanged — existing files are never overwritten.

- **Per-agent personal memory via basic-memory MCP:** Set `PRX_BASIC_MEMORY_ENABLED=Y` (Settings → Agent Memory) to give each of the 7 agents (Morgan, Alex, Sam, Jordan, Henk, Riley, Bryan) a persistent `basic-memory` MCP project. Personal memory compounds individual calibration data, corrected assumptions, and recurring surprises that belong to the agent rather than the shared KB. Storage defaults to `~/.prevoyant/personal-memory` — kept **outside any KB clone** so personal memory stays local to each developer's machine and never accidentally rides along with shared KB git pushes. Override via `BASIC_MEMORY_HOME` if you need a different location. The `basic-memory` package is now pre-fetched during plugin install (`setup.sh` / `setup.ps1` step 5/9 runs `uvx basic-memory --version` to prime the uvx cache), so first-run MCP startup is instant — no lazy download on first ticket.

- **qpdf auto-install:** `setup.sh` and `setup.ps1` now include a step 4/9 that attempts to install `qpdf` via the platform's package manager (Homebrew, apt, dnf, winget, Chocolatey, Scoop). Falls back to download instructions with the GitHub releases URL. Steps renumbered 1–9/9 across both scripts (step 5/9 added for basic-memory).

- **Setup script fixes:** `setup.ps1` corrected `ccusage` → `codeburn` in the permissions allowlist and section header. Both scripts now consistently reference the `codeburn` budget-tracking CLI.

- **Cost trend includes failed runs:** The dashboard's "Cost trend — 30d" sparkline now aggregates `costUsd` from both `ticket_completed` and `ticket_failed` events. Failed runs spend real tokens, so excluding them under-reported daily cost.

- **KB Flow Analyst (Javed) — autonomous CMM contributor:** A new background worker (`server/workers/kbFlowAnalystWorker.js`) runs as Javed, the team's senior-developer KB analyst persona. On a configurable day interval it queries Jira for recent incidents, auto-discovers the highest-impact business flows from real ticket data (no manual flow configuration), traces them in the repo, and proposes Core Mental Map entries to `~/.prevoyant/knowledge-buildup/kbflow-pending.md` tagged `Status: PENDING APPROVAL`. The panel votes at the new Step 13j (Dev Mode) / R9i (PR Review Mode) — nothing reaches `core-mental-map/` without unanimous approval. Configure via `PRX_KBFLOW_ENABLED` / `PRX_KBFLOW_INTERVAL_DAYS` / `PRX_KBFLOW_LOOKBACK_DAYS` / `PRX_KBFLOW_MAX_FLOWS` (Settings → KB Flow Analyst). A new dashboard page at `/dashboard/knowledge-builder` shows worker status, run history (`~/.prevoyant/knowledge-buildup/kbflow-sessions.md`), pending/approved/rejected counts, and a Run-Now button to trigger an off-cycle scan. Activity events `kbflow_scan_started` / `kbflow_scan_completed` / `kbflow_scan_failed` flow through the existing notifications + activity log pipeline.

### v1.2.9 — WhatsApp Notifications + Activity Tracking + ast-grep Code Search

- **WhatsApp notifications via WaSenderAPI:** A new `server/notifications/whatsapp.js` module (zero new npm dependencies — uses Node's built-in `https`) dispatches concise one-liner WhatsApp alerts for any selected ticket lifecycle event. Messages are brief and emoji-tagged — `✅ IV-3804 complete`, `❌ IV-3804 failed`, `👁 IV-3804 watch digest sent`, etc. Fires from `activityLog.record()` alongside the existing webhook dispatch, so every event source (tracker, watcher, routes) is covered automatically.

- **PDF reports delivered as WhatsApp documents:** When `PRX_WASENDER_PUBLIC_URL` is set, report events (`stage_dev_report`, `stage_review_report`, `stage_est_report`) additionally send the PDF as a WhatsApp document. A new `GET /dashboard/reports/serve/:filename` endpoint serves PDFs from `CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR` so WaSenderAPI can fetch them — path-traversal safe, PDF-only.

- **Independent WhatsApp event selection:** `PRX_WASENDER_EVENTS` is a separate comma-separated list from `PRX_NOTIFY_EVENTS`, letting you configure email and WhatsApp independently. The Settings → WhatsApp Notifications section provides the same checkbox grid as the email Notifications section, plus fields for API key, recipient number, and public URL.

- **Watch events tracked in Activity log:** Ticket watcher activity is now visible on the `/dashboard/activity` page. New event types: `watch_added`, `watch_stopped`, `watch_resumed`, `watch_removed` (recorded from routes), `watch_poll_started`, `watch_poll_skipped`, `watch_poll_completed` (with `emailed` flag and `reason`), `watch_poll_failed`, `watch_completed`. The worker emits `activity` messages to the main thread, which routes them to `activityLog.record()` — same pattern as other worker event dispatch.

- **ast-grep structural code search in Step 5:** The Locate Affected Code step now uses a three-pass search sequence: **Pass 1** — grep (fast candidate filter across the whole repo, ~0 tokens), **Pass 2** — ast-grep (`sg`) for structural precision (finds method calls, subclasses, and overrides by AST pattern, eliminating false positives from comments and string literals), **Pass 3** — targeted Read of the confirmed line range. A reference table of common Java patterns is embedded in the step. The class hierarchy search is updated to use ast-grep `class $NAME extends {Parent}` patterns. Falls back to grep-only if `sg` is not installed.

### v1.2.8 — Ticket Watcher

- **Jira ticket monitoring with AI digests:** A new background worker (`server/workers/ticketWatcherWorker.js`) polls any Jira ticket on a configurable schedule (every hour, day, 2 days, or 5 days). On each poll it builds a structured four-step Watch Mode prompt (W0–W3: KB Query → Fetch Ticket → Progress Analysis → Digest Output) and invokes the Claude CLI with the configured Jira MCP — no direct API calls for the analysis itself. Claude fetches all ticket details and comments, then produces a structured digest: **Ticket Summary**, **Progress Assessment**, **Blockers & Concerns**, **What Should Happen Next**, and an **Overall Verdict** (ON TRACK / NEEDS ATTENTION / BLOCKED / STALLED). The digest is emailed via the existing SMTP stack. Zero new npm dependencies.

- **Jira change detection — skip unchanged polls:** Before invoking Claude, the worker makes a lightweight Jira REST call to fetch a snapshot of the ticket (`updated`, `commentCount`, `lastCommentUpdated`, `status`) and hashes it. If the hash matches the previous poll's snapshot, the Claude invocation is skipped entirely (no email sent, no tokens consumed). Claude only runs when the ticket has actually changed. The snapshot hash is persisted per-ticket so skips survive server restarts.

- **Poll log files:** Every poll (whether Claude ran or was skipped) writes a timestamped log to `~/.prevoyant/watch/logs/{TICKET_KEY}/`. The live log tail is streamed to the Watch dashboard in real time while a poll is in flight. Log retention is controlled by `PRX_WATCH_LOG_KEEP_DAYS` (default 30 days) and `PRX_WATCH_LOG_KEEP_PER_TICKET` (default 10 files per ticket); cleanup runs from the Disk Monitor page.

- **Dedicated Watch page** (`/dashboard/watch`): Add tickets with a key + interval + optional max-poll-count form. The table shows live status, poll counts, last/next poll times, and a truncated digest preview. Per-ticket actions: **Poll now** (immediate on-demand digest + email), **Stop**, **Resume** (restores a stopped ticket to active watching), and **Remove**.

- **Live progress panel:** While a poll is running, a blue in-progress card appears at the top of the Watch page showing which ticket is being processed and a real-time step log as Claude announces each stage. The page polls `/dashboard/watch/json` every 3 seconds and patches the table (status badges, poll counts, timestamps, blinking eye) without a full reload.

- **Animated eye icon on watching tickets:** Active tickets show a blinking eye SVG animation, making it immediately obvious which tickets are under active surveillance.

- **Survives restarts:** Watched tickets, their poll history, and snapshot hashes are persisted to `~/.prevoyant/server/watched-tickets.json`. The worker reattaches all active watches automatically on server start.

- **New config keys** (all editable in Settings → Ticket Watcher): `PRX_WATCH_ENABLED` (Y/N), `PRX_WATCH_POLL_INTERVAL` (default interval), `PRX_WATCH_MAX_POLLS` (default max polls, 0 = unlimited), `PRX_WATCH_LOG_KEEP_DAYS` (log file retention in days), `PRX_WATCH_LOG_KEEP_PER_TICKET` (max log files per ticket). Worker starts/stops reactively when the setting is toggled — no restart required.

### v1.2.7 — Indexed Agent Memory + Real-time KB Sync

- **Indexed agent memory with dual-backend support:** Each completed session is indexed (ticket key, summary, key findings, cost, timestamp) into a local JSON file at `~/.prevoyant/memory/index.json` and optionally into Redis. At session start, the server pre-loads the most relevant prior-session entries and injects them into the agent's context — replacing a full KB scan with a targeted lookup. This achieves a ~96% token reduction on the prior-knowledge retrieval step while keeping agents grounded in past work. The memory backend is selected via `PRX_MEMORY_INDEX_ENABLED` (JSON, default Y) and `PRX_REDIS_ENABLED` (Redis, takes priority when enabled). Both are written simultaneously when Redis is active so the JSON index stays warm as a hot-standby.

- **Live KB propagation across machines:** When a session completes on any machine, `server/kb/kbSync.js` does a `git push` (KB files travel to the private repo) then posts a ~100-byte notification to an [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) stream — just `{ machine, ticket, commit }`. Every other connected machine is polling `XREAD` every 10 seconds (configurable); on a new notification it immediately does `git pull --rebase` and invalidates its local KB cache. Idle machines stay in sync between sessions so Step 0 KB queries always reflect the latest state. **No KB content ever touches Redis** — the stream is the doorbell, Git is the mail carrier.

- **Dual sync trigger modes:** `PRX_KB_SYNC_TRIGGER=session` (default) pushes after each session completes. `PRX_KB_SYNC_TRIGGER=filesystem` watches the KB directory for file changes and syncs immediately (useful when KB files are edited directly). `PRX_KB_SYNC_TRIGGER=both` enables both. A debounce (`PRX_KB_SYNC_DEBOUNCE_SECS`, default 3 s) prevents rapid-fire pushes on bulk writes.

- **Zero new npm dependencies:** The Upstash REST API is called with Node's built-in `https` module. A worker thread (`workers/kbSyncWorker.js`) runs the poll loop without blocking the main server process, following the same pattern as the existing health and disk monitors.

- **New config fields (all under `KNOWLEDGE BASE` in `.env`):** `PRX_REALTIME_KB_SYNC` (Y/N, default N), `PRX_UPSTASH_REDIS_URL`, `PRX_UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN`, `PRX_KB_SYNC_MACHINE` (hostname override), `PRX_KB_SYNC_POLL_SECS` (default 10), `PRX_KB_SYNC_TRIGGER` (`session` | `filesystem` | `both`), `PRX_KB_SYNC_DEBOUNCE_SECS` (default 3). All fields are also editable from the dashboard Settings page. Free tier on Upstash is more than sufficient.

### v1.2.6 — Henk, Agent Personas & Personal Memory

- **Henk — Technical Lead:** A seventh panel member has joined the Engineering Panel. Henk is a long-tenured system expert with encyclopedic knowledge of business rules and client workflows. Attentive to detail and drawing on years of first-hand system experience, Henk's role is to assess whether a fix is genuinely necessary and whether it delivers real value to existing clients — not all bugs need fixing, and not all fixes are client-safe. Morgan consults Henk at two key moments: **Step 7h-ii** (after the verdict — is the root cause a genuine defect and does fixing it bring client value?) and **Step 8c** (fix review — does the proposed change align with business rules and preserve client behaviour?). Henk is non-competing; he participates in all three modes (Dev, PR Review, Estimate) with a business-rule and client-impact lens.

- **Agent persona definitions:** Seven persona files — one per team member — live in `plugin/config/personas/`. Each file defines the agent's voice and communication style, reasoning approach, priorities, and relationships with other team members. Personas are static, developer-editable documents: any team member can open a persona file and refine it to better reflect how the agent should think and speak. Because each agent has a separate file, concurrent edits by different developers never produce merge conflicts. Agents read their persona at session start (Step 0b Layer 5) so their character and reasoning style are grounded before any analysis begins.

- **Agent personal memory:** Each agent now accumulates a personal memory that grows smarter with every session. At the end of every session (Step 13i), each participating agent writes a structured memory file to `{KB_WORK_DIR}/personas/memory/{agent}/{YYYYMMDD-TICKET}.md` capturing: what they observed, what predictions they made and whether they were right, what surprised them, and short-lived notes for the next session. At the start of each new session (Step 0b Layer 5), agents read their last five memory files and internalise the accumulated context before engaging — so an agent with 30 sessions behind them arrives knowing which areas of the codebase surprised them before, which patterns they tend to over-fit, and what they got right and wrong. **Conflict-free in distributed mode:** each session creates a uniquely named file (timestamp + ticket key), so concurrent sessions from different developers always produce new, non-overlapping files that git auto-merges without conflict.

- **Prior Knowledge block extended:** The session Prior Knowledge block (Step 0b) now includes an `AGENT PERSONAS & PERSONAL MEMORY` section summarising each agent's session count, last ticket, and most relevant personal insight for the current ticket.

- **KB directory structure:** `personas/memory/` subdirectories are initialised alongside all other KB directories on first run — in local mode, distributed mode, and the encrypted temp-dir path. All `mkdir -p` commands updated across every init path.

### v1.2.5 — Update Checker, Windows Server Scripts, Plugin Rename

- **Automatic update checker:** A new background thread (`workers/updateChecker.js`) polls the GitHub repository at random intervals between **6 and 24 hours** to detect when a new plugin version is available. When a newer version is found, a yellow banner appears at the top of the dashboard showing the current vs latest version, a "View changes" link to GitHub releases, and an **Upgrade now** button. Clicking Upgrade runs `git pull --ff-only` in the repo root then automatically restarts the server — the button gives live feedback and the page reloads when the restart completes. A one-time email notification is also sent per new version (using the configured SMTP credentials). No new env vars required — runs automatically on every server start.
- **Windows server scripts:** New start/stop scripts for running prevoyant-server on Windows. Use `server\scripts\start.cmd` / `stop.cmd` from Command Prompt (or double-click in Explorer), or `server\scripts\start.ps1` / `stop.ps1` from PowerShell directly. Mirrors the same PID-file approach as the existing macOS/Linux `start.sh` / `stop.sh` — checks for a stale PID, installs npm deps if missing, runs `node index.js` in the background, and writes `.server.pid`. The dashboard's **Upgrade now** flow is also platform-aware and uses the PowerShell scripts on Windows.
- **Plugin rename:** Plugin identifier and skill prefix changed from `prevoyant-claude-plugin` to `prevoyant`. Install command is now `claude plugin install prevoyant@dodogeny`; skills are invoked as `/prevoyant:dev`, `/prevoyant:dev review`, `/prevoyant:dev estimate`. The npm `package.json` name (`prevoyant-claude-plugin`) is unchanged as it is not the Claude Code identifier.
- **Mid-job budget & billing monitoring:** While a ticket is being processed, a background check runs every 60 seconds comparing month-to-date spend (via codeburn) against `PRX_MONTHLY_BUDGET`. If the limit is reached the job is stopped automatically. Additionally, Anthropic billing errors in the process output (e.g. "credit balance is too low") are detected and trigger an immediate stop. Both cases are reflected in the dashboard without a page reload.
- **Interruption reason on dashboard:** Every interrupted job now shows a coloured banner on its detail page explaining why it was stopped — **budget exceeded** (red), **account balance too low** (red), **server restarted** (blue), or **stopped manually** (orange). The reason is persisted to disk and shown on the initial page load as well as surfaced live via the polling loop when a running job is interrupted.
- **codeburn migration:** Replaced `ccusage` with `codeburn` for all token cost tracking — session snapshots, dashboard budget cards, and the `SessionStart` hook. The `setup.sh` script installs codeburn globally on first run.

### v1.2.4 — Scheduling, Notifications, Queue Priority, Auto-retry, KB Backup/Import, Activity Tracker, Health Monitor, Disk Monitor

- **Scheduled ticket processing:** When adding a ticket via the dashboard, optionally set a future date/time for processing. Scheduled jobs survive server restarts — the schedule is persisted to disk and re-armed automatically on startup. Missed schedules are marked `interrupted` rather than silently dropped.
- **Delete ticket:** Each ticket row now has a delete button. A confirmation dialog warns that all ticket information will be permanently removed before proceeding.
- **"Next Scan" info strip:** The dashboard header now shows the exact date/time the next scheduled poll will run (previously showed time since last startup, which was not actionable).
- **Queue priority:** Tickets can be flagged as **Urgent** at submission time (inserted at the front of the queue). Any queued ticket can also be promoted to the front via a **Prioritise** button on its row. A priority badge distinguishes urgent jobs visually.
- **Auto-retry on failure:** Failed jobs are automatically retried up to `PRX_RETRY_MAX` times with exponential backoff (`PRX_RETRY_BACKOFF` seconds base, doubling each attempt). Retry countdown is shown on the ticket row. Retries can be cancelled via the existing stop button. Both settings are configurable in the Automation section of Settings.
- **Notifications settings section:** New Settings section to configure email alerts. Requires `PRX_EMAIL_TO` to be set. Options include:
  - **Level:** Full (all events), Compact (one summary email per job), Urgent (issues and decision prompts only), Mute (disabled)
  - **Mute for N days:** Temporarily suppress all notifications for a set number of days
  - **Event checkboxes:** 18 granular events across 5 groups — Jira (ticket created, updated, assigned to me), Job Lifecycle (queued, started, completed, failed, retrying, stopped, scheduled), Pipeline Dev stages (R&CA, Propose Fix, Impact Analysis, PDF Report), Pipeline Review stages (Panel Review, PDF Report), Pipeline Estimate stages (Planning Poker, KB Update)
- **Webhook & Polling section rename:** The "Webhook Server" settings section is now "Webhook & Polling" with a clearer description of the poll interval field and its fallback role.
- **KB Backup & Export:** Settings page now shows knowledge base file counts and a **Download Backup** button that streams a `.tar.gz` archive of the entire `~/.prevoyant/` directory.
- **KB Import:** Upload a `.tar.gz` backup directly from the dashboard. Existing files are never overwritten — only new files are extracted. Partial success (some files kept) is reported separately from a full failure.
- **Health Monitor (Watchdog):** An optional in-process background thread (`workers/healthMonitor.js`) that polls `GET /health` on a configurable interval and sends an urgent email alert when the server stops responding. Enabled via `PRX_WATCHDOG_ENABLED=Y` in Settings › Health Monitor. Configurable check interval (`PRX_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_SECS`, default 60 s) and consecutive-failure threshold before alerting (`PRX_WATCHDOG_FAIL_THRESHOLD`, default 3). Sends a recovery email when the server comes back up. Planned shutdowns via `stop.sh`, dashboard restart, or `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` send a graceful-stop signal to the thread so no false DOWN alert is fired. Uses the SMTP credentials already configured in Email Delivery — no extra dependencies. Note: as an in-process thread it shares the process lifecycle; a hard OS kill (`SIGKILL` / OOM) cannot be caught by any in-process solution.
- **Activity Tracker:** New page at `/dashboard/activity` (accessible via the Activity link in the dashboard header). Records every significant server event across 19 event types: ticket lifecycle (queued, started, completed, failed, interrupted, retrying, scheduled, deleted, prioritized, re-run), pipeline stage transitions, Jira webhook events (received or skipped with reason), Jira poll runs (`poll_triggered` with trigger label), server starts, settings saves, and KB export/import. Each event captures timestamp, event type, ticket key, actor (system/user/jira), and structured details. Three live Chart.js graphs show events per hour/day/month (toggled), tickets processed over 30 days, and token cost (USD) over 30 days. Filterable table by event type (all 19 types always shown regardless of history), ticket key, actor, and date range. History is persisted to `~/.prevoyant/server/activity-log.json` (within the server-specific subfolder) and survives server restarts with no data loss. Legacy `activity-log.json` at the old path is auto-migrated on first start.
- **Disk Monitor:** An optional in-process background thread (`workers/diskMonitor.js`) that tracks the total size of `~/.prevoyant/` against a configurable size quota (`PRX_PREVOYANT_MAX_SIZE_MB`, default 500 MB). Enabled via `PRX_DISK_MONITOR_ENABLED=Y` in Settings › Disk Monitor. Configurable check interval (`PRX_DISK_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MINS`, default 60) and cleanup interval (`PRX_DISK_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_DAYS`, default 7 days). An alert fires when the folder reaches `PRX_DISK_CAPACITY_ALERT_PCT`% of the quota (default 80%, so at 400 MB of a 500 MB quota), giving early warning before the hard limit is hit (4-hour cooldown between repeated alerts). Overall machine disk capacity is still shown on the page for reference but does not drive alerting. When the cleanup interval elapses, a pending-cleanup notification appears on the **Disk Monitor page** (`/dashboard/disk`) — a dashboard **Approve Cleanup** button must be clicked before any files are deleted (no automatic deletion). An additional **Run Cleanup Now** button is always visible for on-demand house-cleaning. Cleanup removes session directories older than 30 days and trims `disk-log.json` and `activity-log.json` to their most recent entries. The page shows a `.prevoyant Quota` progress bar (MB used vs. quota), a two-column table of what will be cleaned vs. what is permanently protected (knowledge base files, reports, `.env`, recent sessions). Knowledge base files are safeguarded at the route level — the resolved KB path is checked before any deletion. History of snapshots is persisted to `~/.prevoyant/server/disk-log.json` (up to 720 entries, ~30 days at hourly checks) and `~/.prevoyant/server/disk-status.json`. A usage-over-time chart (Chart.js) shows `.prevoyant` folder size and overall disk utilisation. A Disk icon in the dashboard header nav turns orange when cleanup is pending.
- **Claude Budget Tracker:** The dashboard shows real-time Claude API spend against the configured monthly budget (`PRX_MONTHLY_BUDGET`). Cost is calculated from local token counts via codeburn (labelled "codeburn calc'd"). Token breakdown (input / cache-read / cache-write / output tokens) is shown in the budget card for transparency. Displayed in two places: a **Budget item in the info strip** (colour-coded remaining) and a **Budget card** in the cards row with progress bar and per-token breakdown. Cache is 2 minutes; saving settings immediately busts the cache.

### v1.2.3 — Prevoyant Server (Ambient Agent) + Path Rebranding

- **Prevoyant Server:** New optional Node.js server (`server/`) that runs as an always-on ambient agent alongside the Claude Code plugin. Start with `cd server && npm install && npm start`. Provides two capabilities:
  - **Real-time webhooks:** Registers with Jira as a webhook receiver (`POST /jira-events?token=WEBHOOK_SECRET`) and triggers `poll-jira.sh` analysis immediately when a ticket event arrives — no polling delay.
  - **Scheduled polling fallback:** Runs `poll-jira.sh` on a configurable day interval (`WEBHOOK_POLL_INTERVAL_DAYS`) as a fallback when webhooks are unavailable.
- **Stats dashboard:** Built-in web dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` showing which Jira tickets have been processed, their current status (queued / running / completed / failed), processing duration, and exact disk locations of generated PDF/HTML reports. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. JSON API available at `/dashboard/json`.
- **Health endpoint:** `GET /health` returns server status and timestamp for monitoring integrations.
- **Path rebranding:** All default paths changed from `~/.dev-skill/` to `~/.prevoyant/` — knowledge base, KB clone, reports directory, and temp session dirs. Existing installations continue to work via the `PRX_KNOWLEDGE_DIR` / `PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE` / `CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR` env vars if you have data you want to preserve at the old paths.
- **launchd plist renamed:** `scripts/com.dev-skill.poll-jira.plist` → `scripts/com.prevoyant.poll-jira.plist` to match the new namespace.

### v1.2.2 — Token Budget Tracking + Estimate Mode

- **Estimate Mode:** New third mode (`/prevoyant:dev estimate PROJ-1234`) where the Engineering Panel runs Planning Poker using the Asana story points methodology — effort measured as **Complexity + Risk + Repetition**, not hours, on a modified Fibonacci scale (1·2·3·5·8·13·20·?). Before voting, each engineer loads the KB (`core-mental-map/`, `patterns.md`, `gotchas.md`, past ticket estimates, lessons learned) so votes are grounded in acquired system knowledge, not gut feel. All five engineers vote simultaneously, then debate is structured by dimension (which of the three factors is causing disagreement?) rather than just "your number is too high." Up to 3 rounds; Morgan makes a binding final call if still split. Confidence level (High/Medium/Low) reflects how many rounds were needed. Agreed points are recorded in the KB as `[ESTIMATE-PATTERN]` entries for future sessions.
- **codeburn integration:** Actual Claude token spend is now measured using [codeburn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/codeburn), which reads Claude Code's local JSONL files offline — no network call, no auth required. codeburn is downloaded automatically via `npx --yes` on first use; Node.js is installed automatically if not present (Homebrew → nvm on macOS, apt/dnf → nvm on Linux).
- **SessionStart budget check:** `scripts/check-budget.sh` runs at every session start. It captures a daily-spend baseline to `/tmp/.prx-session-start-spend` (used by Step 11 for per-session delta) and injects the current month's actual spend and budget status into Claude's session context. A system-level warning is surfaced when spend ≥ 80%.
- **Step 11 / R7 / E7 — actual costs:** Instead of estimating tokens from content volume, Claude now runs `npx codeburn@latest report --format json` and subtracts the session-start baseline to report the exact cost of the current session. Manual estimation is retained as a fallback when Node.js is unavailable.
- **Step 14 / R10 / E7 (Bryan) — realtime token stats via codeburn:** Bryan runs `npx codeburn@latest report --format json` (month-to-date spend and session delta against the check-budget.sh baseline) to get authoritative figures from Claude Code's local JSONL logs — no network call, no auth. Monthly spend replaces the manual `process-efficiency.md` sum; session cost feeds the per-ticket rolling average used for TOKEN_ALERT and BUDGET_ALERT detection. Falls back to Step 11 figures and the manual sum if codeburn is unavailable.
- **Bryan — token intervention:** Bryan now records each ticket's cost against the 5-session rolling average. When a session costs > 150% of the rolling average (**TOKEN_ALERT**) or monthly spend exceeds 80% of `PRX_MONTHLY_BUDGET` (**BUDGET_ALERT**), Bryan escalates from the normal single-change proposal to **Intervention Mode**: identifies the top 3 most expensive steps, proposes a targeted SKILL.md reduction for each with dollar-savings estimates, and presents them as a ranked set for team consensus. BUDGET_ALERT additionally projects how many sessions remain before the monthly limit is breached at the current burn rate.
- **Developer confirmation gate:** Before Bryan applies any approved SKILL.md change (Step 14c) or compaction pass (Step 14d), an interactive confirmation box shows the exact before/after wording, problem solved, process impact, and estimated token saving. The developer must explicitly confirm before any file is modified. Skipped automatically in `AUTO_MODE=Y`.
- **Permissions:** `Bash(npx --yes codeburn@latest *)` added to `.claude/settings.local.json` allowlist so the budget check runs without prompts.
- **Setup scripts:** `scripts/setup.sh` (macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash) and `scripts/setup.ps1` (Windows PowerShell) auto-detect the OS and install all prerequisites in one pass — `uvx`, Node.js, pandoc, `.env` copy, and `~/.claude/settings.json` marketplace registration. `scripts/setup.cmd` provides a double-click launcher for Windows CMD users. Installation cascades through available package managers (Homebrew → nvm on macOS; apt → dnf → nvm on Linux; winget → Chocolatey → Scoop on Windows) with graceful fallback and platform-specific manual instructions on failure.

### v1.2.1

- **Core Mental Map:** New `core-mental-map/` KB folder — a compressed, always-growing codebase model (architecture, business logic, data flows, tech stack, gotchas) contributed by agents every session via `[CMM+]` markers. Agents read it at session start, cross-check against live code, and write corrections or confirmations back — so the team's collective understanding compounds with every ticket worked.
- **Knowledge Base:** Merged `PALACE.md` and `INDEX.md` into a single `INDEX.md` file with two sections (`## Memory Palace` and `## Master Index`). Simplifies retrieval — one file, two layers.
- **Distributed KB — first contributor:** Added checks to ensure `PRX_KB_KEY` is set when required (encrypted repos) and that the first-time contributor flow handles an existing remote branch gracefully.
- **Email reports:** `send-report.py` delivers PDF/HTML analysis and review reports via SMTP immediately after saving. Configure via `PRX_EMAIL_TO` and `PRX_SMTP_*` env vars.
- **PR Review diff:** Review mode (Step R4) now uses `git diff` to detect changed files precisely, restricting the review panel to only the files actually modified on the feature branch.
- **Plugin registry:** Published as `prevoyant@dodogeny`.
- **Token efficiency:** Engineering Panel complexity gate (Step 7b-pre) fast-paths simple fixes; context pruned before Step 9; Riley made conditional on engineer divergence; KB integrity sweep at session start.
- **Polling script:** `--force TICKET-KEY` re-queues a previously seen ticket; `PRX_JIRA_PROJECT` scopes JQL to a single project.
- **Configurability:** `PRX_REPORT_VERBOSITY` (full/compact/minimal) controls terminal output without affecting PDF content; `PRX_ATTACHMENT_MAX_MB` caps non-image attachment size (default: unlimited).
- **Resilience:** MCP retry-with-backoff (3 attempts, 30 s apart) before failing; PDF tool pre-check at session start with graceful fallback.
- **KB stale detection:** Opportunistic validation during file reads; auto-heal writes `RELOCATED`/`DELETED` tags in Step 13c rather than silently leaving broken references.
- **Lessons Learned:** New `lessons-learned/` KB folder — per-developer files for recording pitfalls and sprint retrospective insights. Agents read all files at session start and surface matching entries in the Prior Knowledge block; `[LL+]` markers let agents flag new lessons during investigation (Step 13h / R9h). Works in both local and distributed mode.
- **Settings fix:** Removed hardcoded absolute path to `SKILL.md` from `.claude/settings.local.json`; replaced with the relative path `plugin/skills/dev/SKILL.md` so the config works on any machine.
- **Bryan — Scrum Master:** New team member (opt-in via `PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED=Y`) who observes every session silently and runs a structured retrospective (Step 14 / R10). Tracks cumulative monthly spend against `PRX_MONTHLY_BUDGET` (default: $20.00 — matching a standard Claude subscription), flagging ⚠️ at >80% and ❌ at 100%. Maintains a prioritised improvement backlog, tracks recurring blockers, proposes one focused SKILL.md sharpening change per session, and runs a full compaction pass every `PRX_SKILL_COMPACTION_INTERVAL` sessions. Requires unanimous consensus before applying; pushes after `PRX_SKILL_UPGRADE_MIN_SESSIONS` sessions.
- **SKILL.md internal versioning & audit trail:** Every Bryan change is recorded with its git commit hash in two places: a `## Skill Change Log` table embedded at the top of SKILL.md (SC#, version, date, commit, type, summary, status) and a full `[SC-NNN]` entry in `shared/skill-changelog.md` (verbatim before/after wording, voters, revert status). Any change can be safely rolled back with `git revert <commit>`.
- **process-efficiency.md merge safety:** Redesigned as an append-only journal (session records, backlog items, blockers expressed as tagged entries, never mutated in-place). Header and velocity dashboard are auto-rebuilt from journal data after every pull — the same pattern as `INDEX.md` — so concurrent pushes from multiple developers are always lossless with `merge=union`.

### v1.2.0

- **PR Review Mode:** New mode triggered by the word `review` — same four-person engineering panel (Morgan, Alex, Sam, Jordan, Riley) operates as code reviewers. 7-section PDF report.
- **Knowledge Base:** Distributed mode with optional AES-256-CBC encryption; Memory Palace retrieval; inline `[KB+]` annotation during active work; `INDEX.md` rebuilt from source files after every pull.
- **Morgan's JIRA Historical Investigation:** Morgan searches closed/resolved JIRA tickets on the same components before every panel briefing.
- **Enhancement workflow:** Direct Analysis path (Step 7-ENH) bypasses the Engineering Panel for enhancement tickets.
- **PDF reports:** Full-detail 11-section report capturing every step output verbatim.
- **Headless mode:** `AUTO_MODE=true` bypasses all interactive gates; polling script (`poll-jira.sh`) triggers analysis on a schedule.

### v1.1.0

- Engineering Panel (Morgan + Alex + Sam + Jordan + Riley) for root cause analysis
- Riley (Senior Lead Tester) added with Testing Impact Assessment and testability challenges
- Class hierarchy check for enhancement tickets
- Jordan's defensive pattern checklist expanded from 11 to 20 patterns
- MCP setup via `.mcp.json` (replacing plugin-based approach)

### v1.0.0 — Initial Release

- 12-step dev workflow: ticket ingestion → branch → locate code → replicate → propose fix → impact analysis → PDF report
- Grep-first, read-second code location approach
- Three-tier base branch priority (fix version → affected version → development)
- PDF generation via pandoc → Chrome headless → HTML fallback
